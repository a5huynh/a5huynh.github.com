Things like retrieving player position, setting player position,\ngetting maps, etc. So long story short, I needed a pathfinding algorithm\nfor the game engine, and my experiment with the A* algorithm began.\nA Little Theory\nFor those who don't know, A* is a best-first, graph searching algorithm\nbased on the infamous Dijkstra's\nAlgorithm. The A*\nalgorithm has been used across the spectrum of applications. The most\npopular use is path-finding in games, but I've spotted it being used even\nweb-based apps like Google Maps or MapQuest (at least I think so).\nFirst of all, an important thing to note about A* is that it uses a\nheuristic. This speeds up the running time considerably, but as a\nconsequence, although guaranteed to find a path, it is not always\nnecessarily the best path.\nFor the best path, you could use Dijkstra's, but that's not always viable.\nDijkstra's running time is a whopping O(V2), where V is the\nnumber of vertices in the graph) compared to A* running time of O(E + V)\n(best best case where E is the number of edges and V is the number of\nvertices in the graph. Another thing to note is that, A*'s running time is\na bit more complex because of the heuristic you can use, but for the best\ncase, with a simple heuristic, you can get a runtime very similar to\nBFS(Breadth First Search).\nUsing different heuristics can vary the running time which can increase accuracy\n(although with a loss of speed)\nThe algorithm is given a start and goal coordinate and when run finds a\npath from start to end. Obstacles (for example, in a game a large boulder\ncould be an obstacle) are introduced into the algorithm by removing edges\nfrom the graph, forcing the algorithm to take into account \"holes\" in the\ngraph.\nImplementation\nNow that we've gotten the theory behind A* out of the way, lets dive into\nmy implementation.\nFirst off we have the Node object.\nfunction Node(parentNode, cx, cy, g, h) {\n  this.parent = parentNode;\n  this.x = cx;\n  this.y = cy;\n  this.g = g;\n  this.h = h;\n  this.f = g + h;\n};\n\nA node represents a certain vertex on a graph. The parent of a Node\nrepresents the vertex in which the algorithm came from to reach this node,\nthis provides a link to previous node in case we want to backtrack, as well\nas an easy way to extract the path the algorithm took. X &amp; Y are simply\nthe graph positions. Now g, h, and f are \"scores\" for the node g is\nthe actual shortest distance from the source node to the current one h is\nthe estimated distance (this is the heuristic) distance from the current\nnode to the goal f is simple the sum of g and h. f is used to\ngenerate a priority for nodes, which has the end result of nodes that are\ncloser to the goal are picked over others.\nNow lets take a look at the core stuff itself. The code that actual finds\nthe path for us.\nAstar.prototype = {\n  // Various Vars\n  _open: [],\n  _closed: [],\n  _path: [],\n  _avail: null,\n  _sx: 0,\n  _sy: 0,\n  _dx: 0,\n  _dy: 0,\n\n  // Public Functions\n  findPath: {},\n\n  // Private Functions\n  _CreateNode: {},\n  _fillChildren: {},\n  _getBestNode: {},\n  _isAvailable: {},\n  _printArray: {},\n  _printNode: {},\n  _ValidTile: {}\n};\n\nLets take a look at the variables and functions used in the implementation.\n_open, _closed, and _path are all used as stacks _open holds a list\nof nodes that are still \"open\", which means that a node has not been\nvisited by the algorithm _closed hold a list of nodes that have been\nvisited by the algorithm _closed is actually not used by the algorithm in\nany way, but was only there for debugging purposes so that I can see the\nnodes the algorithm accessed during tests _avail is an array that is used\nto quickly determine whether or not a node has been accessed. _sx, _sy,\n_dx, and _dy are the source and destination coordinates.\nNow for the functions findPath is the only public function, and returns\nthe path the algorithm found _CreateNode _fillChildren _getBestNode\nan _isAvailable are used by the algorithm to find the path.\nThe algorithm itself is in findPath and is shown below...\nfor(var count = 0; count &lt; 100; count++) {\n  bestNode = this._getBestNode();\n  if( bestNode == null ) break;\n  this._path.push( bestNode );\n  if(bestNode.x == this._dx &amp;&amp; bestNode.y == this._dy)\n    break;\n  this._fillChildren( bestNode );\n}\n\nA simple for loop is all it takes. The reason I used a for loop is to check\nagainst impossible paths. The number of nodes the algorithm accesses should\nnever be more than the number of vertices in the graph, which in my test\ncase was 100 (10x10 grid). All this loop does is retrieve the next node,\ncheck if it has reached it's destination and then if not, add the children\nof node to the open list, where the process is started all over.\nSo how is the best node retreived?\nAstar.prototype._getBestNode = function() {\n  if(this._open.length &gt; 0) {\n    var bestNum = 0;\n    var bestF = this._open[0].f;\n    // Cycle through open list until the best node is found.\n    for( var idx = 1; idx &lt; this._open.length; idx++) {\n      var tmpF = this._open[idx].f;\n      // Favors the last added node if there are\n      // nodes with the same F.\n      if(tmpF &lt;= bestF) {\n        bestNum = idx;\n        bestF = tmpF;\n      }\n    }\n    // Remove node from open list and place into closed\n    // list.\n    var bestNode = this._open[bestNum];\n    this._open.splice(bestNum, 1);\n    this._closed.push(bestNode);\n    return bestNode;\n  }\n  return null;\n};\n\nSince the _open list is unordered (a quality that we can easily fix to\nimprove the runtime even more), I loop through the entire list to find the\nnode with the lowes f score. Because of the nature of how nodes are\nadded to th _open list, this favors nodes that have been last added\nwhen there are nodes with the same f score. The node is then removed\nfrom the _open list and return to be processed some more.\nSo far, you've only seen how nodes are picked, but the key to this\nalgorithm is how the node scores are determined, because the rest is simply\na BFS using these scores as a priority.\nAstar.prototype._fillChildren = function(node) {\n  // Top (North) Tile.\n  if( this._ValidTile(node.x, node.y-1) )\n    this._CreateNode(node, node.x, node.y-1);\n  // Right (East) Tile.\n  if(this._ValidTile(node.x+1, node.y))\n    this._CreateNode(node, node.x+1, node.y);\n  // Bottom (South) Tile.\n  if(this._ValidTile(node.x, node.y+1))\n    this._CreateNode(node, node.x, node.y+1);\n  // Left (West) Tile.\n  if(this._ValidTile(node.x-1, node.y))\n    this._CreateNode(node, node.x-1, node.y);\n};\n\nAstar.prototype._CreateNode = function(node, x, y) {\n  // Check to see if node is not on closed list\n  if(this._isAvailable(x, y)) {\n    var tmp = new Node(node, x, y, node.g+1,\n        distance(this._dx - x, this._dy - y));\n    avail[y*NUM_ROWS + x] = 1;\n    this._open.push(tmp);\n  }\n};\n\n_fillChildren grabs the children around a specific node and adds them\nto the open list. In this case, I only choose the nodes directly above,\nbelow and to the sides. However, this can easily be expanded where all the\nsurrounding nodes are added. So first a potential node is checked for\nvalidity (is it out of bounds? has it already been added?) and then if it\nis valid, the node is created and added to the _open list. The g\nscore is incremented because it is one square farther than its parent from\nthe source node. The h score in the algorithm uses the Manhattan\ndistances formula which\nis the sum of the absolute differences of two coordinates Changing this\nformula to other ones can speed up the process of pathfinding with worse\nresults or impede the process with better results.\nReferences\n\nA* Algorithm Wikipedia Entry\nAn excellent page containing tons of information about variations you can make\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2008/javascript-a-implementation/","title":"Javascript A* Implementation"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2008/mtp-multitouch-table-prototype-v2/":{"body":"For those who don't know, I'm currently the President of the Computer\nScience and Engineering Society here at UCSD.

Below is the description\nwe sent in to our professor as part of our project describing what we did.\n\n\nPicture a lone survivor of a dangerous war that has ripped his world apart. Our hero, a penguin,\nthe last of a mighty and powerful race hurtles through space seeking shelter, refuge, and some cheesy snacks.\nOur final project scene consists of a procedurally generated planet that sits against a starry night sky.\nThe planet is separated into 4 levels, ocean, coast, lush terrain, and mountains.\nThe planet's lush terrain zone is spotted with fractal trees randomly dispersed across the planet.\nAll of this is done in toon shading, modified slightly so that the world looks as if it was sketched.\nZooming down from space following a bezier path, you'll fly past the planet's bump-mapped moon and\nonce landed on the planet you'll be able to navigate the planet as a penguin using the keyboard\nW,A,S,D keys and the mouse. A scene graph is used to handle rendering and animation of the planet,\ntrees and penguin. To handle drawing the huge amount of trees on the surface of the planet\nwe use a combination of view frustum culling and a basic form of occlusion culling.\nThe key 'T' can be used to toggle textures, 'O' toggles outlines, 'P' toggles the planet rendering,\n'G' toggles toon shader, 'N' toggles planet normals, '&lt;' zooms out of the planet, '&gt;'\nzooms towards the planet, '/' stops the zoom action, 'B' toggles bump mapping of the moon,\n'C' toggles the ability to see the bezier curve path, 'R' randomly generates another planet.\n\nGood stuff right? As part of a series of articles I plan on spending my\nwinter break writing on how we managed to do each part, this will be the\nzeroth! The prelude if you may where I show off all the cool stuff we did\nto whet your appetite for more! A little warning, at lot of this will be a\nrehash of what I said in previous posts since this is the final summary of\neverything we did.\n\nThe very beginning of our scene starts off with us looking directly at a\nsmall planet and it's moon. From there we zoom in on the planet whipping\naround the moon in the process to show off the bump mapping we applied to\nit. Bump mapping is a great\ntechnique in computer graphics applications, that simply put, is used to\nmake a simple object (such as a sphere in our instance) look more detailed\nthen it really is. In our case the moon looks as if has ridges and craters,\nand ergo much more highly detailed than a simple smooth sphere.\n\nMoving along in our scene we approach our planet in with the ability to see\nthe finer details of the terrain. The terrain itself was procedurally\ncreated using a slightly modified version of particle\ndeposition,\na really nice terrain generation algorithm that gives us that nice\narchipelago look I was trying to achieve. The trees are also procedurally\ngenerated using a simple fractal algorithm and are randomly dispersed on\nthe planet's \"green\" zone. Now the problem with rendering around 500\nfractal trees on screen that the same time is that it's incredibly\ntime-consuming and our frame rate took a huge hit when it was first\nimplemented. To deal with this we use a simple form of occlusion culling,\nwhich means that anything behind the planet will simply not be drawn. One\nof the screenshots attached shows how trees behind the planet are not being\nrendered at all. This speeds up rendering of the scene by around 2x-3x\nbased on how many trees are cut out of the rendering pipeline.\n\n\nAnd finally we land on the planet where we are able to move around as a\nlittle penguin across the surface of the planet. Movement is a bit hacked\ntogether at this point, and in all honestly sucks, but we were luckily able\nto get together a semi-working version done by the time presentations were\ndue. The penguin is a simple 3D model created in\nBlender, and is rotated and moved along the\nplanet based on where it is on the planet.\n\nAll in all the presentation went well, people were amazed at the level of\ncomplexity we managed to achieve in a relatively short time and we had tons\nof fun doing it!

The major bottleneck was getting a project room to\nstore all of our equipment (which took nearly a quarter to get =[ ),\nbut now that that's out of the way, we're good to go! (See picture for\na glimpse of our great view of the engineering courtyard!)\n\nThe main goal of v3 is move towards a fully functional multitouch table\nthat we can cart from place to place. Over the weekend (actually 2\nweekends ago from this post) we managed to put together a decent frame,\nas well as take apart a 19'' LCD screen we're using for the actual\nsurface. We've placed this all together to get a rather decent looking\n(and functioning) surface that we are able to move around.\nYou can see our success in the photos I've attached. It's quite solid\nand gives us tons of space to work with in regards to where we're going\nto put the camera, processors, etc.\nPreliminary tests show that our lasers are a bit weak (10 mw), so in an\nattempt to get some good blobs, I ordered some stronger ones (25 mw) as\nwell as IR bandpass so that the LCD backlight doesn't get in the way of\nthe blob detection. All in all, we're simply waiting on these parts to\narrive before we can progress with actually getting everything put\ntogether.\nWe're also working on some experimental methods to do away with the\ncamera completely. If it works, it would enable us to build a thin\nmultitouch surface. Thin in the sense of somewhere around 2-4 inches\nthick, versus the 20+ inch height required for the camera.\nHope you enjoy this little update!

The trees themselves are fractal trees and procedurally created ( they all look the same however, but a simple rand() call to modify branch position, etc should fix that ). The tree positions are calculated based on the planet's height map so that trees don't end up where they shouldn't be ( such as in the ocean or on top of a mountain ) and are randomly distributed across the planet's \"green zone\". Looks quite nifty doesn't it =].\nObject Culling\n\nAll in all, we have around 500 trees on screen at a time which is highly detrimental to our frame rate. To remedy this, we have two forms of culling in action at the moment. One is the normal view frustum culling, which means we simply do not render any objects that can not be seen in the view of the camera, and second is a basic form of occlusion culling. Now occlusion culling essentially means that we don't draw any objects that are being blocked by another object, which works well with our planet and trees scene. If you look at the screenshots I attached, you can see that on one of them, with the planet rendering turned off, you can see only half the trees are actually being rendered. This improves our frame rate by around 2x depending on how sparse the trees are on either side of the planet.\nPenguins\n\nAnd finally our protagonist in the scene, our beloved penguin. The penguin is a model I created when learning Blender, an open source 3D modeling and animation program. As of now all we can do is render the penguin on the planet. Moving it along with the camera with a little animation added is in the works, but should hopefully be done by tonight!

The fact that I am still standing here\ntoday is a testament to the sheer amount of work that it took to keep me\nchugging along all these years.\nMuch later in life after my ego had deflated I realized that I had my\nparents (and more specifically my mother) to thank in all this. We'll never\nquite see eye- to-eye but it'd be silly to expect otherwise.\nFamily Gatherings\nMother's Day is a grand occassion in my family. We hold a brunch/lunch of\nsome sort at home or at some fancy restaurant and recount stories of yore.\nThe stories are funny and the food in ample supply and delicious.\nUnfortunately, the conversation always comes back to me. I'm the oldest of\nthe pool of kids that make up my cousins and quite frankly I have a much\nmore interesting life than those glue eating brats.\nYesterday's gathering was a little more fun because it would be the first\ntime anyone would really know outside of my parents and sister that I'm\nworking towards my doctorate degree. This is mainly because my parents\ndon't really like announcing news that hasn't been set in stone,\nfossilized, and then dug back up out of the ground. I have no clue why, I\njust deal with it and start recounting what I've been doing the past year.\nRoughly translated from memory, here's how it went:\n\nMe: Yeah it's been fun so far. I've been working crazy hard, there's\nthis cool -- \nGrandma: Isn't so-and-so's daughter doing a Ph.D? \nGrandpa: Yes that's right! And she's around Andrew's age isn't she? \nUncle (who I might add, always does this to me): You're single\naren't you? You should go and say hi. \nMe: I'm still taking applications, it's a long process. Loooot's of\npaperwork \nGrandma: I could introduce you, she's a nice girl. \nAunt: Are you sure, I mean isn't so-and-so's daughter better looking? \nMe: Wait, no, what? \nGrandpa: No we're joking, no girls for you until you graduate.\n\nThis has been happening at every family gathering recently. Working towards\na doctorate degree is big news in my family, since no one really has\nanything close. I like to think I'm inspiring my younger cousins towards\ngreatness. This is before they start throwing rocks at me and chasing me\naround the house. Then I pretend I'm godzilla and they're little twigs or\nbuildings and start pushing them around.\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2011/mothers-day-anecdotes/","title":"Mother's Day Anecdotes"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/":{"body":"","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/","title":""},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/a-year-in-recap/":{"body":"Another year in closing, another one of those fantastic yearly recaps that I have the joy of writing. If I had these printed, why I could almost hear the sweet crumple crumple as people turn my riveting tales of adventure into a jump shot.\n\nFirst off, before I begin my long ramble I would like to thank those of you who have made it thus far and a pre-emptive thanks for those of you who make it to the end. Hopefully you will enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it =]. As much as this is a recollection of my own triumphs and adventures, I must remind the readers ( and often times myself ) that many of those same triumphs and adventures never would have happened without the unyielding support and talent of my friends and family.\nAnd so it begins!\nCreating a Hack-a-thon Dynasty\n\nA taste of what sort of monsters haunt you on caffeine fueled deliriums.\nMany may know of my friend and lover roommate David Vanoni with whom I share many victories. Over the past couples years we have taken home the grand prize in countless, innumerable events. I can't even begin to recount the 2-3 things we've won over the years.\nThis year was no different. I wager it was perhaps even slightly crazier than years past.\nFor those of you who don't know, Yahoo! holds a yearly 24 hour hack-a-thon where they invite students from all over the UCSD campus to think up an idea, implement the idea, and present the idea in the span of 24 hours. Pretty snazzy, n'est pas?\nDavid and I have lead 2 winning teams in the past. The first created a music search engine based on lyrics. A few of you oldies may remember that, so I'll give you a moment to sigh in nostalgic remembrance. The second created an iPhone app that took into consideration your location and music tastes and found nearby concerts/shows/events that you'd enjoy seeing. This year we decided to pull out all the stops and set the bar so high and unreachable that years later they will erect statues and hold parades for our efforts.\nWhat's In Your Fridge?\nHonestly now, could anyone really remember exactly what they have in their fridge at any given moment? Our idea aimed to solve that through SCIENCE. We would have sensors talking to a server so that you'd be able to use your iPhone or computer to check what was in your fridge. While you're there you could find some recipes based on what you had and even connect up your friend's fridge to coordinate meals together. The original idea was the brainchild of the lovely Leilani Gilpin. She had presented the idea in a class of hers earlier in the quarter and I loved it. To me it had all the components of a grand idea: it was relatively simple and solved a major problem that everyone encounters.\nThe Fab Four\nOur team this year had the lovely addition of Lynn and Leilani along with David and I. We had all worked together on projects in the past and have been friends for millennia. Needless to say our group formed a formidable force of brain power and technological prowess. David lead the hardware side with an initial prototype created by me involving an Arduino, WiFly board, and pressure sensors. The sensors turned out to be not as accurate and precise as we had originally wanted, but David was able to work around that and have the sensors talking to our server ( which was also setup by him ). During most of the 24 hours I worked intently on the client side creating interface mockups and writing the code necessary to get it all running. Lynn and Leilani also helped out on the client side and worked on the recipe search and friend collaboration code.\n\nOur application at a glance\nWithout getting into the nitty gritty details of how everything was created and my eventual delirium and subsequent caffeine binges, our hack came out incredibly well-done. We had a couple weak spots, such as requiring a strong WiFi signal or the pressure sensors being a little spazzy, but in the end we were all happy with the product we created and nothing could rain on our parade.\nThe competition this year was intense with several other well-done ideas and fun implementations. We were all delirious from lack of sleep.\nThird place was announced.\n\nMe: You know guys, we should be happy that we did what we did in the time we\nhad.\n\nSecond place was announced.\n\nMe: I wonder which team won this year. A lot of great contenders, not sure\nwe're up to snuff this year honestly.\n\nFirst place announced. It was us!\n\nMe: BOO-YAH! SUCKERS! Wooooo. High-five guys. We did it!\n\nA couple people have already asked whether David and I will taking another team to dominance next year. All I can say is that if we were to come back, we'll be taking home the national title next year as well.\nThe Adventure\n\nWhere we're going, we don't need roads\n\nOne year ago, if you had told me that next summer I would be riding horses, pushing trucks through mud, and become the MVP of an NatGeo vs Mongolia soccer match I'd have a hard time believing you. Heck, I still have a hard time believing I did any of the stuff I did on that expedition.\nThe Path Less Taken\n\nHurggh?\nI'm still not quite sure how much I'm allowed to divulge about our findings so I'll keep this short and sweet.\nI was involved in a National Geographic Expedition to Mongolia with the aim of uncovering the Tomb of Genghis Khan. I and a large group of scientists ranging from electrical engineers, to geophysicists, to historians and archaeologists traveled for days across hard terrain, torrential downpour, and run-ins with friendly and not-so-friendly natives.\nWe spent a solid 3-4 weeks at our archaeological site doing some intense work. Roughly a month or two worth of work was finished in that small span of time by multi-tasking, parallelization, and just sheer will. If you were sitting still then you were doing something wrong. As a fine-tuned, well-oiled machine our work went from sun up til sun down and completely drained us. Even with those hardships, I consider those times were one of the best I have ever experienced. One moment we could be setting up to do some geophysics and the next we'd be scrambling to get equipment under cover as rain begins to pour down on us. Mosquitos devoured us and laughed at our puny bug sprays. Rushing up a mountain on horse back and then back down again because of the threat of lightning. Incredible moments just seemed to cease.\nA Day of Games\nA couple days of our expedition was spent next a nice large river in which we could bathe and relax after 4 weeks of intense work. Here we also had horse races, foot races, and a soccer match pitting the scientists/engineers and the mongolians against each other in feats of skill and athleticism.\n\nThis is when we decided it was a good time to stop.\nThe backdrop for our soccer game was a seemingly never-ending field of lush green grass contrasted by a slow moving thunderhead sweeping visible torrents of rain and lightning towards us as we played. I had scored an early goal much to the delight of my European comrades and assisted several attacks which lead to another goal by our NatGeo photographer. At the end of the first half the mongolians scored a goal and I swapped with the goalie after a light ankle sprain on my dominant foot left much to be desired in my kicking ability. After many spectacular saves, a slide tackle, and fruitless attacks by both sides, the second half ended as the thunderhead finally came close. Victory was ours, a close 2-1, but a victory nonetheless. All of us then joined together to rain-proof our gers and dig in for the storm to come.\nThe Korean Paradise\nIt's not often ( or ever really ) that one refers to an airport as paradise, but the South Korean airport deserves a special mention. It has free, public showers. Cheap beers. And a store where you can paint your own paper fans. Paper fans man. Paint them for free. Need I say more?\nAfter 4 weeks of rolling around in dirt, trudging through mud, and a little something I like to call 20 men, 1 outhouse the expedition members were all ready for a nice scrub down, a cold beer, and most of all -- a nap.\nFurther Inquiries\nI don't want this to become too long so I'll leave it at that. I have many more tales to tell, some funny, some not-so-much and all end on good note. So for those of you who know the story, know that I left my mark on a Mongolian park bench. For those who don't, buy me a beer and I promise I will regale you with tales of adventure, horror, and laughter.\nFrom the Plains of Mongolia to the Urban Jungles of New York\nNew York, New York. The Big Apple. I'll never forget the moment I landed in JFK after gazing down at the city lights below. People abuzz on their phones calling their mothers, friends, bookies and the charming hustle and bustle as everyone forced their way out of the aircraft at the exact same moment.\nWe made it big! After our victories last and this year at the Yahoo! Hacks the winning teams flew to New York to participate in a global version of the event. People from all across the globe ( including Brazil, India, and more ) flew in, creating a total of 19 world-class groups of tremendous skill and talent. Again our goals were the same -- come up with an idea, implement the idea, and present the idea. All within 24 hours.\nThe Fab Five\nWe were the combination of two winning teams since Yahoo! was not able to hold a global event last year. It was I, David, Leilani, Lynn, and Matthew. A battalion of the brilliant, a calvary of the capable, a legion of the learned, a tour-de-force of talent. We are the Fab Five.\nRocking Your World\nOur idea stemmed from ruminations I've had with a Professor at UCSD who specializes in machine learning, more specifically the automatic annotation and understanding of music. We had bounced around the concept of using a user's actual location as a way to recommend music. Since humans are very habitual and there tends to be a correlation between the type of music we listen and where we actually are at the moment, we believed using location or activity based inputs could form improved recommendations. The team and I developed this idea over the course of the 24 hours keying in on certain activities a normal person might do in the span of a day. Hitting the gym, studying at the library, walking in the park, en route to a party -- all of these could be boiled down to a handful of inputs readily available on your phone.\nWe went to work building this monstrosity. My usual caffeine binges, delirium and inhuman focus set in on creating a masterpiece. We wanted to win and we wanted it bad.\nAfter approximately 24 plus hours we called it quits and took a nap for 4 hours. We then spent the night celebrating our near win to dawn.\nDrinks, Sushi, and then more Drinks\nNew York is probably the finest city in the world in terms of culinary prowess. World famous chefs and restaurants create a delicious environment for our taste buds to inhabit and our short stint in New York was no exception.\nMatt and I share a mutual taste in what I like to call, Damn Good Food. Food that our taste buds will look back on and tell their grandchildren about. The problem with the majority of Damn Good Food is that it is Damn Expensive. However, I am willing shell out the money when it comes to fine dining and we spared no expense. Steaks, sushi, sandwiches, and even the wine. All of it absolutely divine.\nA mere 4 hours after the hack event had ended we ( David, Matt and I ) made our way over to Anthony Bourdain's Les Halles. There I would savour and reminisce about the perfect slice of beef ever to be laid in front of me. Every cut as smooth and silky as a cut of butter, every bite an explosion of flavor and wonderful juices. We all shared tears of happiness and pure joy.\nCheers\nOnce again thank you for making thus far. I hope you enjoyed the journey as I much as I did creating it.\nAndrew\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/a-year-in-recap/","title":"2011 - A Year in Recap"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/academic-posters-design-and-content/":{"body":"Recently I have been involved in the process of designing and creating an\nacademic poster detailing portions of my research in a manner that conveys it\nin a clear, meaningful way. This turns out to be very difficult task.\n\nPoster and research writing bear many similarities. Both attempt to convey your\nideas in a form that can be digested by an audience whom may or may not have\nthe same background knowledge or skillset. Thus, conveying complex ideas\nthrough a research paper can be difficult; conveying complex ideas through a\nposter becomes insurmountable. [The Science of Scientific\nWriting](http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/feature/the-science-of-\nscientific-writing/1) said it best with the following:\n\nScience is often hard to read. Most people assume that its difficulties are\nborn out of necessity, out of the extreme complexity of scientific concepts,\ndata and analysis.\n\nBut as they go on in the article, this isn't always the case. The major hurdle\nin the end is not the research itself but communicating the information to\nthe reader. This leads me to my next point:\nAcademic Posters Suck\nThere I said it. They do. Perhaps not all of them, but definitely a large\nnumber of the posters I have run across.\nSome attempt to mash what seems to be an entire paper on the same subject onto\na small rectangular area. Others are aimless and seem to be splatter of charts\nand graphs with no coherence. But most of all, they all suffer from lack of\ndesign and lack of readability.\nDesign and Readability\nLack of design indicates the lack of structure and coherence in the poster and\nnot simply the lack of aesthetics. Although the two may go hand-in-hand.\nI posit that many of these problems are the consequence of trying to cram an\nenormous amount of information into a small area. This causes sections of text\nto be pushed around and consequently, different relevent sections may end up in\nlocations that are simply not conducive to normal reading and scanning.\nAdditionally, even with a simple, decent design some posters still have\ndifficultly conveying the information to the user.\nDesign of My Poster\nAs I created my poster, I tried to take all those observations to heart.\nImportant elements are highlighted and cruft/filler are faded out but still\neasily found.\nLayout\nBefore placing any content, I sketched out an initial layout. The layout was\ndesigned to keep in mind a left to right and top to bottom reading path.\nColumns of information are clearly cut-out and encapsulated.\n\nA major problem I had with posters is the lack of structure and a clear\nflow of information. My design attempts to add a bit of that to aid reading\nand analysis.\nContrast\nReadability is improved from normal posters by employing contrast in the\ncorrect amounts throughout the poster. The contrast shows up in the form of\ndifferent colors and/or typography used to differentiate between different\nelements. For example, an image caption may be color highlighted with a\ndifferent font in such a way that anybody skimming over the poster could easily\njump over the information if needed.\n\nImage captions and important text are easily distinguishable from normal text.\nAnd after all that work... the final product!\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2012/academic-posters-design-and-content/","title":"Academic Posters - Design and Content"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2013/":{"body":"","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2013/","title":""},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2013/new-beginnings/":{"body":"The end of another year.\n\nIt is time again for another exciting chapter in Blog Posts I Only Write\nBecause I Feel Guilty About Not Writing Blog Posts. In years past, I've\noften recounted numerous stories of adventure and victories. This year will\nbe a little different. It has been a remarkable year filled with ups and\ndowns but ultimately a lot learning.\nResearch Recap\n\nPeople say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing everday.\n- Winnie-the-Pooh\n\nLooking back, my research has been surprisingly running much smoother than\nI originally believed.\nI became one of the founding members of the Distributed Health\nLab, helping to mold and develop the vision for future health\ntechnologies. We currently have an indiegogo campaign, which I\nurge you to check out =).\nIn March, I presented a paper on visualizing noisy crowdsourced data\nat the Aerospace Conference. This was a fun experience which allowed me to\njump on some quality slopes outside of the Sierras and meet a lot of very\ninteresting people part of the aerospace industries. Additionally, I have\njust found out that I will again be attending this conference, this time\npresenting on work we did in relation to crowdsourcing damage assessments\nright after the 2011 Japan Tsunami disaster.\nTowards the middle of the year, I became an author in the forthcoming\nHandbook of Human Computation, specifically the chapter on Search\nand Discovery in relation to my work with the Valley of the Khans\nteam. An exciting chapter of my life which I hope to continue partaking\nin.\nAdditionally, fantastic progress was made towards the completion of my\nPh.D. with my well received [research exam](https://github.com/a5huynh\n/research-exam) presentation. Only 2 out the 3 members on my committee fell\nasleep during the presentation, which I consider a win.\nFinally, I spent some much needed time away from the states exploring\nSouthern France and Amsterdam as part of a trip to the\nDigital Heritage conference.\nRamblings\nAbove you see successes. A glossy image over which a very different\ninterior resides. Reading between the lines, there has been a lot of\nturmoil, stress, blood, and tears that have lead to this point in the\njourney.\nI find that it is difficult for people to talk about failures. Failures are\nembarrassing. Nobody wants to make themselves feel or look any less than\nthey really are. However, failure is what got us to this point in the first\nplace.\nIt is easy to say it, it is even easy to believe it, but to truly act upon\nthis concept is another matter. So here I'll talk about my big failure of 2013\nmost importantly how I and perhaps some other schmuck along the way can\nlearn from it.\nBottling it up.\nI have skirted many disasters and confrontations by simply biting my tongue\nand moving on. Perhaps I have caused many more by doing the same. A\nconsequence of this is that many of those emotions and thoughts get bottled\nup. For some, more fleeting matters, this is manageable since by the end of\nthe day it no longer an issue. But when matters become more than simply\nfleeting this is a difficult and inefficient manner to handle things. As a\nresult, I did a lot of things I am not proud of and hurt some people who\nwere very close to me. Thus, my biggest, if not most important lesson for the\nyear is managing these issues in a way that can be more productive.\nWhile not a hardcore Buddhist, I find their doctrines at the very least\nmeaningful and at most useful life guidelines. The Four Noble Truths\nas laid out by the doctrine talk about \"suffering\", which in modern times\nis often understood as conflict in one's life. This could be through simple\neveryday vexations or more long-term stresses. Becoming attached to these\nvexations and stresses (a.k.a bottling it up) can create an awful feedback\nloop which does nothing to help and all but amplifies the problem at hand.\nBuddhism is not alone in confronting these issues. Marcus Aurelius hammers this\npoint all across Meditations:\n\nYou have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and\nyou will find strength.\n\nAnd more:\n\nIf you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the\nthing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to\nrevoke at any moment.\n\nI'll stop myself there. Does spewing quotes from doctrines and philosophers\nreally help? Maybe. It is comforting to know that people have been\nstruggling with the same ideas for thousands of years and that the same\nwisdom applies even to the conflicts of today.\nAt the risk of completely misinterpreting the point, it all boils down to:\nconflict is unavoidable. There will always be something that will elicit\na reaction. And thereine lies the lesson, for our actions and responses to\nthat certain something will define how we interact with those around us,\nwhether it be in a useful, productive way or less so.\nThanks\nThis took much longer to write than I ever through, but I would like to end\nwith a special thanks to those who have been with me this year through\nthick and thin. 2013 was definitely an exciting year, and I can only\nimagine what is in store for 2014!

It molded him into the person he would become.\n\nCollege and graduate school seemed so short-lived and unproductive to be\nconsidered my version of Hemingway's moveable feast. During that time, I\ncan not deny meeting incredible people and learning incredible skills. But\nit didn't feel as if there was a clear path to move any further from where\nI was and what I was doing. Keeping with the feast metaphor, those days\nfelt more like appetizers and I needed to move on to the main course. Life\nis filled with many moveable feasts, some smaller and some larger than\nothers. Perhaps the time I'm spending here in San Francisco will be of the\ngrander ones. Time will tell.\nCamaraderie\n\nFor what are we born if not to aid one another?\n\nWhenever you put together a large cohort of people in a single location you\nwill evitably foster a community of peers. There is struggle and passion.\nThere is strength and humility. There is fear and there is success. You are\nplaced on trial everyday and watch others sit through the same. And it's\nremarkable how we come back day after day to face those same plights\nagain and again.\nSome would argue that the atmosphere created by this mish-mash of different\nteams and people would make it difficult to be productive. At a glance this\nis true, there are distractions at every turn. However, distractions will\nalways be there in one form or another. The greater value is seeing others\nspend just as many late nights and long days, struggling with the same\nproblems, and coming together with the same solutions.

To all those folks at 500 Startups and\nCode for America, I look forward to hearing about great results and even\ngreater successes.\n+++\nFor my friends, near and far, I hope the new year brings many more views just like the one below.

There are even classes where the very purpose\nis to mentally train those who wish to push their limits.\n\nThese classes often follow a straightforward and very rigorous regimen designed to push limits over and over. Here's a dramatized example:\n\nFirst, practice climbing at the cusp of your limits.\nNow practice falling. Ideally a little above your comfort zone.\nPractice falling from even higher.\nDo it again.\nAnd then do it again.\n\nThe idea is to prime yourself into doing the same difficult movements over and\nover until it no longer becomes difficult, both physcally and perhaps more\nimportantly -- mentally. This becomes significant seeing as how nagging feelings of doubt and uncertainty are perhaps more dangerous than the actual act of climbing itself.\nWhen you are focusing on the distance from the ground or worrying about stray\nrocks, you block out the very actions that protect you the most. Remembering to\nclip in or check your placement; keeping correct form so that you don't get too\ntired; and of course, having that clarity of mind to react in case there\nis an emergency.\nAnalysis Paralysis\nThe phenomena of \"lead head\" is not something that is isolated to climbing.\nThere are examples throughout life of what is usually dubbed analysis\nparalysis, causing even the\nbest people to stumble in situations they may have done hundreds of times\nbefore.\nA fun example I recently discovered is a card game called rejection\ntherapy. I find it akin to the mental training\nregimen for climbers albeit for every-day situations. The game seems designed\nspecifically to put people through life's awkward situations so they can adapt\nto the inevitable rejection and failure while most importantly making light of\nthose moments. You are not successful if you are not being rejected.\nAt the very core, analysis paralysis is what happens when you are alone in the\necho chamber of your mind. Ideas as well as uncertainty begins to reverberate\nand wave after wave of what if washes over you. More often, it's not even\ndoubt, but simply the feeling that something is not quite good enough and what if you spend a little more tweaking this and tweaking that. what if you made the wrong choice? what if it was all for naught? what if?\nThe Art of Start\n\nOrganizational design, process design, metrics, hiring and firing were all\nrelatively straightforward skills to master compared to keeping my mind in\ncheck.\n~ Ben Horowitz, The Hard Things About Hard Things\n\nThe mind is our greatest asset but it might as well be our greatest enemy.

[source]\nJFK's rally around the space race was incredibly important and very intentional\nat the time. The year the speech was delivered, there was a perception that the\nAmericans were losing the space race. The Soviets had launched Sputnik and put\nthe first man in space. Landing on\nthe moon seemed like an impossible feat, especially when it seemed that the\nnation was already far behind.\nEver since hearing about the speech, Kennedy's words continue to resonate with\nme, a reminder in tough instances that sometimes we do things simply because\nthey are difficult, because they are uncomfortable, and because the challenge\nis one that will push us farther than we ever could before. In a single\npowerfully compelling moment, Kennedy turns the act of facing the challenge\nitself into one that serves to push us as a human race and as humans. Kennedy\nwants us to relish the fact that we are seemingly behind because the the act of\nlanding on the moon will be that much greater of a victory in the end.\nHowever, it can be silly to do something because it's hard, as the following\nXKCD bit illustrates. There has to be a little\nsubstance to make the challenge worthwhile.\n\nSourced from Lunar Swimming\nOf course, a worthwhile challenge is hard to define and find. This is\nespecially evident in an age where any issue, big or small, can be instantly\nheard by millions, if not billions, of people around the world. Some have\nlamented the youth stating that there seems to be a\ndisconnect between what they believe is worthwhile and what is not. Others\npoint to our generation as largely mission driven and moreso\nthan previous ones. Personal observations suggest a mixture of both and as part\nof the lamented youth, all I can say is that time will tell.\nAfter Kennedy's speech in 1962, it wasn't until 1969 that the United States\nlanded the first humans on the moon, ending the Space Race and creating the\nincredible legacy that still lives on to this very day. Recently, the New\nHorizons probe reached its\ndestination after 9 long years, capturing never before seen images of Pluto in\nincredible quality and providing scientists with innumerable important\nobservations.\nThe ending thesis, if there was one, is that in the midst of the nitty gritty\nof trying to solve difficult problems, we sometimes lose sight of the reasons\nthat brought us here in the first place. Maybe it was the desire to push forth\nthe human race, save the planet, or maybe it was to push ourselves into\nuncharted terrority.

A cycle in a CPU is often broken\nup into a series of steps known as the instruction pipeline,\ncreating a form of parallelism within the CPU as shown below.\n\nAn example of a simple instruction pipeline: Fetching the instruction,\ndecoding it, executing it, and writing the value back to memory. Image source\n\nBranches are a problem because the jump to a different area of code in memory\ncan not be determined until that specific instruction is executed, potentially\nmaking the instructions in the pipeline after it useless and leading to a loss\nof precious CPU cycles.\nAll of this can be avoided by having branch prediction logic as instructions\nare being read. A predictor can be as simple as predicting that the branch will\nalways/never be taken and become as complex as a multi-layer perceptron.\nPerceptrons\nThe perceptron, which dates back to 1957, is the simplest example of an\nANN, learning a binary (meaning either 0 or 1, yes or no, etc.) classifier\nbased on a set of binary inputs, a set of weights for each input, and a single\nthreshold.\n\nAn example of a perceptron taking inputs \\(x_1, x_2, x_3\\) leading to the\noutput\nLets take the example shown above. We want the decision (the output) made by\nthe perceptron to be related to each of the inputs. To do this mathematically,\nwe can just add all those inputs together. But what if we want to ignore one of\nthe inputs? This is where the set of the weights for each input comes into\nplay. Adjusting the weight to be closer to 0 means that input should have\nlittle impact on the overall decision. Adjusting the weight to be very large\neither negatively or positively means that input should have a very strong\nimpact on the overall decision. Putting it all together, if we were to compute\nthe impact it would look something like this:\n$$ \\mbox{output} = x_1 * w_1 + x_2 * w_2 + x_3 * w_3 $$\nTo turn this sum into either a 0 (no) or 1 (yes), we can apply a cutoff\npoint or a threshold to the sum. For instance, if we have a threshold of 5\nand \\(\\mbox{output} \\leq 5\\) it will be classified as 1. If the\n\\(\\mbox{output} \\gt 5\\) then it will be classified as 1. This can be more\ncompactly respresented with the following equation:\n$$\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\mbox{output} &amp; = &amp; \\left \\{\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n0 &amp; \\mbox{if} \\sum_i x_i * w_i \\leq \\mbox{threshold} \\\\\n1 &amp; \\mbox{if} \\sum_i x_i * w_i &gt; \\mbox{threshold}\n\\end{array}\n\\right .\n\\end{eqnarray}\n$$\nWe may understand the perceptron mathematically, but what does it mean when\nused in decision making? Say we want to use a perceptron to create a model of\nwhether we should eat a bowl of ice cream for breakfast. We could weigh that\ndecision using several different factors:\n\nIs it chocolate ice cream?\nIs it a warm summer day?\nAre you going on a run today?\n\nEach one of these factors may be more or less important than the other. Perhaps\na bowl of ice cream is a preemptive reward for a run and you will not eat it\notherwise, meaning #3 would be highly weighted while the others would be not.\nYou can think of the threshold as how much all the factors contribute to your\noverall motivation to each a bowl of ice cream. For example, if you have a\nthreshold of 0, then eating the ice cream is an easy decision, almost\nregardless of the inputs. If you have a higher threshold, then it will take\nmore motivation from each of those factors before you make your decision. By\nvarying the number of inputs, weights for each input, and the overall threshold\nyou can create all sorts of different decision-making models, and not just for\nice cream!\nLearning from the Past\nNow that we know a little more about perceptrons, this section will apply these\nconcepts to branch prediction. Learning from branch prediction is\nstraightforward since we know whether we made the right prediction right after\nthe branch occurs.\nThe first instance of using neural networks for branch prediction appeared\naround the year 2000, in a paper titled \"Dynamic Branch Prediction with\nPerceptrons\". It proposed a method that used perceptrons to learn\nthe correlations behind the history of the branch and the outcome of a branch.\nThe intuition is that the history of whether a branch was taken or not taken in\nthe past could have bearing on whether this branch will be taken now. An\nexample of this in action would be in code loops where we iterate over many\nitems and make some sort of check.\nSo how does this work? First we need to answer some questions:\n\nHow do you encode a history of branches?\nHow is this information passed to the perceptron for a prediction?\n\nGlobal History Register (GHR)\nIf we consider a the outcome of a branch as a binary output (either taken or\nnot) we can represent the history of that branch as a series of bits. For\nexample, if the first time a branch is seen its taken, we start off with 0000 0001. Then if it's not taken taken, we have 0000 0010. As we take more\nbranches, we continually shift the history left and capture the outcome of the\nbranch.\n\nRepresenting history using a single 8-bit register is beneficial in the space limited world of CPUs\nNow when a branch is being considered, we can now use the history as inputs to\nour perceptron. But what about the weights? And how do we take it account\nright/wrong predictions after a branch happens?\nTraining the Perceptron\nOnce the perceptron makes a prediction we can use it and the actual outcome of\nthe branch as a means to adjust the input weights and train the perceptron.\nIntuitively, if a piece of the branch history has a positive correlation to\nwhether a branch is predicted taken we want the weight for that input to be\nlarge. If there is negative correlation, we want the weight for that input to\nbe negative. And if there is a weak or no correlation, the weight should remain\nclose to 0 so that it contributes little to the final output of the perceptron.\nIn the example below, to make our math a little easier, we'll treat a branch\nbeing taken as 1 and not taken as -1. The actual outcome will increment the weight if it agrees and decrement if it disagrees -- satisfying our intuition above.\n\nHere we train a perceptron using the actual outcome and branch history, shifting the history once we're done to make the next prediction.\nAnd that's all there is to it! As time goes on, the perceptron sees more and\nmore branches creating a correlation (or negative correlation) in the inputs\nand weights with the ultimate outcome of the branch.\nIf you're interested in learning more about the branch predictor and the paper\n goes much more in-depth on how this is can be done in hardware and\nalso provides a nice comparison to other techniques.\nThe branch less taken\nWhile Jiménez finds that the perceptron predictor has a lower misprediction\nrate on all except two different benchmarks when compared to two other\ntechniques, we don't really see the perceptron predictor in modern day CPUs\ndespite being used in most state of the art prediction schemes. A quick search\nbrought up a press release from AMD that touts \"Neural Net Prediction\",\nbut not much else.\nA major disadvantage and one that may be the biggest blocker to uptake of the\nperceptron predictor is the increased computational complexity when compared to\nthe relatively simple counters used in other techniques. This overhead may not\nbe worth it when there are easier ways to add CPU performance, such as\nadditional cores, increased L1/L2 caches, and/or single instruction, multiple\ndata (SIMD) instructions.\nThanks for taking the time!

This only requires a tiny refactoring of\nour current code due to how Three.js handles vertex colors. Choosing\noffsets is a bit of trial and error depending on how large we choose the\ndisplacement factor in terrain generation. In this particular case, since\nour displacement factor is pretty tiny (0.1), our offsets reflect that.\n_color( height: number ): THREE.Color {\n    // Ocean\n    if( height &lt;= 1.01 ) {\n        return new THREE.Color(0x55bbff);\n    // Sand\n    } else if( height &lt;= 1.05 ) {\n        return new THREE.Color(0xffff00);\n    // Grassland\n    } else if( height &lt;= 1.15 ) {\n        return new THREE.Color(0x00ff00);\n    // Mountains\n    } else {\n        return new THREE.Color(0xfffffff);\n    }\n}\n\nColoring is as simple as finding a cutoff for the terrain type we're trying\nto represent. In this case, we're splitting the terrain into ocean, sand,\ngrassland, and mountains.\nSecondly, we modify how we create Face3 objects, using the _color\nfunction above to assign a color upon creation.\n_face( x: number, y: number, z: number ): THREE.Face3 {\n    let face = new THREE.Face3( x, y, z );\n    face.vertexColors[0] = this._color(\n        this.geometry.vertices[face.a].length()\n    );\n    face.vertexColors[1] = this._color(\n        this.geometry.vertices[face.a].length()\n    );\n    face.vertexColors[2] = this._color(\n        this.geometry.vertices[face.a].length()\n    );\n    return face;\n}\n\nNow that we have the vertex colorization accomplished, let's take a stab at\nfixing the distortion in the UV sphere geometry through the use of another\nsphere geometry -- the icosahedron.\nIcosahedron\nThe icosahedron is a\npolyhedron with 20 faces where each face retains its form no matter where\nit appears on the sphere, unlike the UV sphere.\nDue this handy property, we can use the icosahedron as a starting point for\na more realistic looking planetoid. Through subdividing the faces in\nincreasing levels of detail, the icosahedron becomes a smooth,\nnon-distorted sphere as seen below.\n\n\nThe algorithm to generate the sphere is pretty straightforward. The\nicosahedron starts off with 20 faces created using a set of 12 initial\nvertices.\n_setupInitialVertices() {\n    let t = ( 1 + Math.sqrt(5.0)) / 2.0;\n\n    this.geometry.vertices.push(\n        this._normalizedVector( -1,  t,  0 ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  1,  t,  0 ),\n        this._normalizedVector( -1, -t,  0 ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  1, -t,  0 ),\n    );\n\n    this.geometry.vertices.push(\n        this._normalizedVector(  0, -1,  t ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  0,  1,  t ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  0, -1, -t ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  0,  1, -t ),\n    );\n\n    this.geometry.vertices.push(\n        this._normalizedVector(  t,  0, -1 ),\n        this._normalizedVector(  t,  0,  1 ),\n        this._normalizedVector( -t,  0, -1 ),\n        this._normalizedVector( -t,  0,  1 )\n    );\n}\n\nAll we need to generate the initial vertices is a single calculation of the\ngolden ratio ((\\tau)) and then applying that around the sphere.\nAfterwards, we'll setup the initial faces and based on the level of detail\nwe want, divide the initial faces into smaller and smaller triangles.\nsetupInitialFaces( ) {\n    // 5 faces around point 0\n    this.faces.push( this._face(  0, 11,  5 ) );\n    this.faces.push( this._face(  0,  5,  1 ) );\n    this.faces.push( this._face(  0,  1,  7 ) );\n    this.faces.push( this._face(  0,  7, 10 ) );\n    this.faces.push( this._face(  0, 10, 11 ) );\n\n    // ... see code for the rest of the face setup code.\n}\n\n// Refine the icosahedron geometry based on the\n// level of detail we want.\nrefineGeometry() {\n    for( var i = 0; i &lt; level_of_detail; i++ ) {\n        let refinedFaces = new Array&lt;THREE.Face3&gt;();\n        for( let triangle of this.faces ) {\n            // Replace the triangle with 4 new triangles.\n            let a = getMidPoint( triangle.a, triangle.b );\n            let b = getMidPoint( triangle.b, triangle.c );\n            let c = getMidPoint( triangle.c, triangle.a );\n\n            refinedFaces.push(\n                this._face( triangle.a, a, c ),\n                this._face( triangle.b, b, a ),\n                this._face( triangle.c, c, b ),\n                this._face( a, b, c ),\n            )\n        }\n        this.faces = refinedFaces;\n    }\n}\n\nAnd voila! One complication with the icosahedron geometry is the mapping of\nthe generated terrain heights to the vertices. Since the icosahedron\ngeometry is not a grid like the UV sphere, we'll have to estimate where a\nparticular vertex would be in the grid.\nIdeally, we'd update our terrain generation code to work nicely with the\nicosahedron geometry, but this saves us a little bit of time and makes it\nso we can reuse the same terrain generation code with different geometries.\n2D terrain map on a 3D surface\nProjecting a 2D terrain map onto the 3D surface will require a little\ntrigonometry. As we're creating the vertices for the planet, we'll convert\nthe (x, y, z) coordinate into a (x, y) coordinate that maps onto the\nterrain. This technique is actually very similar to how you would generate\ntexture coordinates to apply a texture to the icosahedron geometry.\nLets take a look at the updated getHeight function in the icosahedron planet\ngenerator below:\ngetHeight( x: number, y: number, z:number ): number {\n    var hx = Math.atan2( x, z ) / ( -2.0 * Math.PI );\n    var hy = Math.asin( y ) / Math.PI + 0.5;\n\n    if ( hx &lt; 0 ) {\n        hx += 0.5;\n    }\n\n    // Since texture coordinates are between 0 and 1\n    // we multiply by the terrain size to give us\n    // a grid location within the terrain map.\n    hx = Math.floor( hx * (this.terrain_size - 1) );\n    hy = Math.floor( hy * (this.terrain_size - 1) );\n\n    // Handle wrapping correctly.\n    if( isNaN( hx ) ) {\n        hx = this.terrain_size - 1;\n    }\n\n    if( isNaN( hy ) ) {\n        hy = this.terrain_size - 1;\n    }\n\n    return this.terrain.getHeight( hx, hy );\n}\n\nHere we use the inverse trigonometry functions atan2 and asin to\nconvert the vertex coordinates into the x, y coordinates we can use to\nreference a height map.\nCombined with the vertex coloring functionality developed earlier, we now\nhave the following, more colorful looking planetoid.\n\n\nFurther tweaking of the terrain generation and blending of the vertex\ncolors would fix some of the artifacts you'll probably see in the planet\nbelow, such as the water/grass terrain stretching up into the mountains and\nhard cutoffs rather than smooth transitions between terrain types.\n\nYou can view the code used in this post\nhere.\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2017/planet-rendering-pt-2/","title":"Planet Rendering Pt. 2"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2017/tbt-planet-rendering/":{"body":"Many moons ago, I worked on a college project that required procedurally\ngenerating a \"realistic\" planet in 3D space. The original implementation created\na mesh in the form of the UV sphere\nand then applied a particle deposition to create the terrain.\n\nI thought it would be a fun project to revisit my implementation and use modern\ntooling to re-create what I had done close to 10 years ago in vanilla javascript\nand WebGL with Typescript and\nThree.js.\n\nYou can view the old project and newer code used in this post\nhere.\n\nRendering the sphere\nThe UV sphere was originally chosen due to time constraints. The code (shown\nbelow) to generate a UV sphere is relatively compact and easy to follow\nmaking for a quick implementation and allowing us to focus on the terrain\ngeneration and animation used in the project.\n    // Columns\n    var gamma = 0.0;\n    var gammaStep = 2 * Math.PI / numFaces;\n\n    // Rows\n    var theta = 0.0;\n    var thetaStep = Math.PI / numFaces;\n\n    // Loop through each row &amp; col in spherical coordinates.\n    //\n    // Note: numPoints = numFaces + 1. You need n + 1 points to\n    // represent n faces.\n    for(var row = 0; row &lt; numPoints; row++) {\n        gamma = row * gammaStep;\n        for(var col = 0; col &lt; numPoints; col++) {\n            theta = col * thetaStep;\n\n            // Convert to cartesian coordinates\n            var x = Math.sin(theta) * Math.cos(gamma);\n            var y = Math.cos(theta);\n            var z = Math.sin(theta) * Math.sin(gamma);\n\n            var v = new Vector3(x, y, z).normalize();\n            this.vertices.push(v);\n        }\n    }\n\nUsing latitudinal and longitudinal lines as a grid, we can loop through each\nrow/column and generate points for the sphere.\nCombining the above code with some Three.js materials and lighting, we get the\nfollowing scene below, a blank canvas in which we can start transforming the\nsurface into believable terrain. Unfortunately at the time, we didn't notice how\nthe area of the faces changed as you moved closer to the equator and poles of\nthe sphere. As you'll see later on, this will come back to bite us when we start\nto apply the tranformations.\n\nNow onto the terrain generation! How do we take this flat spherical surface and turn it into\nthe rugged planet we want for our scene?\nParticle Deposition\nParticle deposition starts with a single point and slowly builds out a land mass\naround that area by randomly moving different directions adding additional\nheight displacement as it goes. If we'd like, at the end of the terrain\ngeneration we can then apply a smoothing function on the resulting land mass to\nmake it look a little less jagged.\n    for( var i = 0; i &lt; numIslands; i++ ) {\n        // Find a random spot on the planet to grow an island\n        var sx = randomInt( 0, width );\n        var sy = randomInt( 0, height );\n\n        for( var itNum = 0; itNum &lt; iterations; itNum++ ) {\n            // Add the displacement to the current height\n            set( sx, sy, get( sx, sy ) + displacement );\n\n            // Pick a direction to go next\n            switch( this._randomInt( 0, 3 ) ) {\n                case NORTH: sx = sx + 1; break;\n                case EAST:  sy = sy + 1; break;\n                case SOUTH: sx = sx - 1; break;\n                case WEST:  sy = sy - 1; break;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\nNote that it's possible to continue moving along a single direction,\ngenerating a ridge. We can box in land masses by making sure future directions are\nwith n of the initial growth point.\nTo see the results of the above code, lets start off with a single landmass and\napply particle deposition. In the following example, I've bumped up the\nresolution of the sphere so that a single island is more noticeable.\n\nTrouble in Paradise\nAs we continued with the terrain generation, one of the main issues we faced was\ndue to how a UV sphere is represented in 3D space. As mentioned previously, the\nsphere is divided up into meridians and parallels, which creates an effect\nwhere faces towards the top and bottom of the sphere are smaller and more\nbunched together, while the faces that are closer to the middle of sphere are\nlarger and more spread out.\n\nFun fact: This sort problem also exists in how we represent Earth. Different\nmap projections will show\nlandmasses in different ways and may distort the actual area/size/shape.\n\nThis distortion can be seen in full effect by bumping up the number of land\nmasses. It wasn't ideal, but since we were only using the planet as part of an\nanimation, as long as we focused on the mid-section of the sphere the distortion\nisn't as evident.\n\n\nFor Next Time\nIn the next post, we'll look at how we can apply height based vertex coloring\nto give our planet more personality as well as other sphere rendering methods\nthat lead to a more natural looking planetoid.\nHope you enjoyed this short foray into sphere rendering and terrain generation.\n\nYou can view the old project and newer code used in this post\nhere.\n\nEdits\n\n2018-04-13: Updated link to particle deposition tutorial.\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2017/tbt-planet-rendering/","title":"TBT: Planet Rendering"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2017/text-analysis-of-bills/":{"body":"As a fun side project, I've been gathering data on bills that are\ngoing through the U.S Senate. So far, the site itself is a pretty simple\nweb app to display bill status information in an easier to digest format.\nThis is the first step of many in my goal for an in-depth analysis of the\ndifferent of bills that are going through the Senate (and eventually House\nof Representatives). Through integration with other publicly available data\nhopefully we can gather some interesting insights that are not normally\nreadily available to a layperson.\n\nIn a series of blog posts, I'm going to use some basic NLP to analyze the bills\nthat have gone through the Senate for the past year and show some pretty\ncharts.\n\nAll code used for this analysis is available here:\nhttps://github.com/a5huynh/bill-analysis\n\nGathering the Data\nBulk congressional data is publicly available as XML for the 115th, 114th,\nand 113th congress via the Congressional Bulk Data site. There are\nadditionally some useful guides and schema docs\non Github, made publicly available by the USGPO.\nLooking at the bulk data site,  the information we are interested in is\ndivided into:\n\nBILLS: Contain the full text of the bill.\nBILLSTATUS: Contains information about that status of the respective\nlegislation, who (co)sponsored the legislation, and a history of actions\nthat have been taken.\nBILLSUM: Contains a short summary text of the bill in question.\n\nFor this analysis, I'll be using the data available in the BILLS and\nBILLSTATUS buckets. If you have clone/forked my previously mentioned\nrepository, you can run the following command in the root directory to\ndownload and setup the data folders.\nmake dl-data\nXML to Plain text\nFirst off, we need to convert the XML formatted data into something\nsuitable for our analysis. Looking at the XML files we've unpacked and\nusing python's built-in XML parsing utilities, we can see\nthat the documents are divided into three sections:\n\nmetadata\nform\nlegis-body: This doesn't appear in every file, just ones that are new legislation.\nAmendments will have the amendment tag in place of legis-body.\n\nWe're interested in text in the legis-body section, a snippet of which I\npulled out and show below:\n&lt;enum&gt;2.&lt;/enum&gt;\n&lt;header&gt;\n    Special resource study of James K. Polk presidential home\n&lt;/header&gt;\n&lt;subsection id=\"id7de0f50b003d4fde9ed1f7dc4c7214b2\"&gt;\n    &lt;enum&gt;(a)&lt;/enum&gt;\n    &lt;header&gt;Definitions&lt;/header&gt;\n    &lt;text&gt;In this section:&lt;/text&gt;20\n    &lt;paragraph id=\"idB162332A1BCB420685364EB582B8E9D6\"&gt;\n        &lt;enum&gt;(1)&lt;/enum&gt;\n        &lt;header&gt;Secretary&lt;/header&gt;\n        &lt;text&gt;\n            The term &lt;term&gt;Secretary&lt;/term&gt; means the\n            Secretary of the Interior.\n        &lt;/text&gt;\n    &lt;/paragraph&gt;\n\nIn each &lt;legis-body&gt; tag there are sections, sub-sections, unique\nidentifiers, headers, and enums some of which may or may not be useful. For\nsimplification, we'll only look at text in the &lt;text&gt; tags and toss\nout everything else, turning the above XML into the text snippet below:\nThis Act may be cited as the James K. Polk Presidential Home Study Act.\nIn this section: The term Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.\nTokenization &amp; Stemming\nNow that we have plain text, next up is tokenizing and stemming the plain\ntext from the previous step.\nTokenization chops up the plain text into an array of strings and\nthrowing away certain characters, such as punctuation/numbers and stop\nwords. Stemming takes this further and allows us to map related\nwords to a single token across an entire corpus. For example, the words\n\"stem\", \"stemming\", \"stemmed\" can all be mapped to the token \"stem\" for the\nsake of analysis.\nBelow, I've pulled out the code snippet used in the repository to extract\nand stem the tokens. This is accomplished with a combination of features from\nspaCy.\nimport spacy\n\nNLP = spacy.load('en', disable=['parser', 'ner', 'textcat'])\n\ndef txt_to_token(txt : str):\n    results = []\n    for token in NLP(txt):\n        # Ignore numbers, stop words, and punctuation\n        if not token.is_alpha or token.is_stop \\\n           or token.is_punct or token.is_space:\n            continue\n        results.append(token.lemma_)\n\n    return results\n\n\nAs a side note, I just want to note that the spaCy documentation is\nwell designed and was really a pleasure to read through and use during\nthis process.\n\nRunning Simple Analyses\nWhen I started down the path for this blog post I was interested in\nuncovering a couple things from the dataset:\n\nTopics of interest often discussed in bills.\nInteresting trends over the years, perhaps correlated with the political\nmakeup of the Senate.\nAnything else we can scrounge up.\n\nLets start with topics of interest. With the tokens we've created in our\ndata preparation step, we can play around with some statistics of the\ncorpus to find anything interesting.\nI'll first start with a basic, word frequency chart just to see if there's\nanything unexpected.\n\nA visualization of the 50 most frequent tokens. Click here\nfor the full image.\nThe top 50 tokens seem normal based on the corpus of data. There are plenty\nof ones we'd expect in legislation and some interesting tokens (e.g.\nsecurity and health) that may point to topics that are most discussed\nin these bills. However, overall, not immensely useful until we can remove\ntokens that are present in all documents.\nTo ignore tokens that appear throughout the entire corpus and bubble up\nwords that may be more interesting, lets use TF-IDF with some\nconstraints on the max document frequency to get a list of important tokens\nin the corpus.\n\nWhat is TF-IDF?\nTF-IDF increases the score of a token proportionally by\nhow many times it shows up in a document, offset by the number of times the\ntoken shows up in the entire corpus.\n\nWith scikit-learn, calculating the tf-idf score for all documents\nis super easy. Here's a small snippet that demonstrates the calculation\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\n\ntfidf = TfidfVectorizer(\n    max_df=0.5,\n    # Note: Since we've already tokenized the documents in\n    # the data preparation step, we'll skip these steps\n    # in the TfidfVectorizer.\n    preprocessor=lambda x: x,\n    tokenizer=lambda x: x\n)\n\n# Features contains all the tokens as used by TfidfVectorizer\nfeatures = tfidf.get_feature_names()\n# Create a matrix where each row represents the tf-idf vector\n# for a particular document.\nscores = tfidf.fit_transform(token_dict.values())\n\nWith the scores in a matrix, we can easily average the tf-idf scores and\npull the tokens with the top scores to get a general sense of the important\ntokens in the entire corpus. Below is a visualization of those scores\nwhich seems to give a better sense of legislative topics, such as\nsecurity, health, education, etc.\n\nA visualization of the top 50 words by tf-idf.

While the Arduino\nIDE is useful for simple sketches, once I moved into anything remotely\ncomplex I yearned for the features provided by modern day text editors such\nas Sublime Text or VS Code. This post documents my journey to the almost\nperfect (for me) dev environment for Arduino and other micro-controllers.\nRequirements\nBefore I started down the path of customizing everything I had a couple\nconstraints:\n\nStandard text editor, with standard text editing features.\nSyntax highlighting, customized to my liking.\nCode completion/IntelliSense.\nCommand line compilation and upload.\nAnd if possible, support for other devices and good documentation.\n\nVS Code Arduino Extension\nMy daily text editor for a while has been Visual Studio Code, an\nelectron based editor that wooed me over from native editors like Sublime\nText through a rich ecosystem of extensions and just really great sane\ndefaults. Hoping I’d still be able to use VS Code as part of my Arduino dev\nprocess, I was able to find the VS Code Arduino extension\ndeveloped by none other than Microsoft.\nThe extension is currently in preview, with a couple issues that may or may\nnot affect your workflow. It interfaces with the Arduino IDE to bring over\nsome handy functionality:\n\nBoard &amp; library manager.\nSerial monitor.\nIntegrated Arduino debugging (through OpenOCD).\n\nGetting IntelliSense to work\nFortunately and unfortunately the extension only get us 80% of the way\nthere. I ran into errors where Arduino symbols like pinMode or LOW/HIGH\nwere undefined and which seemed to be a common issue that\nother Arduino hobbyists encountered.\nThe fix is simple, we need to set up our include paths so that VS Code\nC/C++ IntelliSense parser knows where to look. Since part of the issue is\nthe inability to recursively walk through the include folders, we'll need\nto explicitly add each folder. This can be accomplished by editing the\nc_cpp_properties.json file to include the following paths:\n\nNote: The c_cpp_properties.json file can be accessed via the command\npalette: ⌘⬆P -&gt; C/Cpp: Edit Configurations.\n\n// note to save some space,\n// $PACKAGES = $HOME/Library/Arduino15/packages/arduino\n\"includePath\": [\n    \"$PACKAGES/hardware/avr/1.6.21/cores/arduino\",\n    \"$PACKAGES/hardware/avr/1.6.21/libraries\",\n    \"$PACKAGES/hardware/avr/1.6.21/variants/standard\",\n    \"$PACKAGES/tools/avr-gcc/4.9.2-atmel3.5.4-arduino2/avr/include\",\n    \"$PACKAGES/tools/avr-gcc/4.9.2-atmel3.5.4-arduino2/lib/gcc/avr/4.9.2/include\",\n    \"${workspaceFolder}\"\n]\n\nThe versions in the paths will change depending on how often you update\nyour Arduino IDE libraries, but should cover all the standard Arduino\nincludes. If you need additional libraries, you should be able to find the\npaths for those roughly around the same area. Custom libraries, such as\nones you’ve written yourself, should ideally be in a lib folder under\nthe same folder as your main sketch file. For example if you have a\nsensor library it’d look like below. The importance of the lib folder\nstructure will come into play in the toolchain section.\nproject/\n├── lib/\n│&nbsp;&nbsp; └── sensor/\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     ├── sensor.cpp\n│&nbsp;&nbsp;     └── sensor.h\n├── Makefile\n└── main.ino\n\nLastly and most importantly, we need to add #include &lt;Arduino.h&gt; at the\ntop of our main sketch file so that the VS Code IntelliSense to start\nworking its magic.\nArduino Toolchain\nWith the text editor now working within the requirements I set earlier, I\nlooked towards compiling and uploading an Arduino sketch file using nothing\nbut the command line. After a little searching I stumbled upon\nArduino Makefile, a fantastic open source project with a very\nconfigurable workflow for sketch compilation and upload.\nIssues and Fixes\nFollowing the example Makefiles, getting up and running with a single\nsketch file was easy. As more files were added to the project there\nwere a couple non-obvious changes I needed to make to my project structure\nand the Makefile to support user-defined libraries.\nFirst, user-defined libraries should have a folder structure that follows a\nfamiliar format:\nlib/\n└── &lt;library&gt;/\n│   ├── &lt;library&gt;.cpp\n│   └── &lt;library&gt;.h\n\nIn the Makefile, we’ll need to define two variables which define the\nlibraries that should be included in the compilation process and the path\nto the user-defined libraries.\nBOARD_TAG = uno\nARDUINO_LIBS = &lt;library name&gt; &lt;library name two&gt;\nUSER_LIB_PATH = $(PWD)/lib\n\n# The following path may be different for you. This path\n# is for OSX users who installed Arduino Makefile via Homebrew\ninclude /usr/local/opt/arduino-mk/Arduino.mk\n\nNow we should be able to run make  to compile the project and make upload to upload the sketch to the connected Arduino board. The Arduino\nMakefile will attempt to auto-detect variables based on your current OS and\nsettings that you have setup already in the Arduino IDE. If you need to\noverride any of variables, such as setting the BOARD_TAG to the board\nyou’re using, simply put the user-defined variable before including the\nArduino Makefile.\nFor easier project management, the best practice is to include Arduino\nMakefile as a git submodule in your project repo and set the include path\nto the submodule.\nSerial Monitor/Debugging\nOnce we’re able to upload a sketch to our Arduino, the last step would be\nto monitor and interactively input data into the serial port connection.\nThis can be for any logs we’re outputting, setting up configurations, etc.\nLuckily, if you’re using any of the tools above there are plenty of ways to\naccomplish this.\nIf you’re using VS Code, the Arduino extension has commands to open a\nserial connection, set the baud rate, and select the serial port.\nUnfortunately, the Arduino extension only allows you to read from the\nserial port.\nArduino Makefile has a built-in command, make monitor that connects to\nthe Arduino with the correct incantations through the screen command.\nWhile this works just fine, I’ve always enjoyed using the feature-ful\nminicom to connect to serial ports. It takes a little configuration but\nthe end result is a more powerful way to interact with the Arduino serial\nconnection.\nMinicom is available on OSX via homebrew:\nhomebrew install minicom\n\nTo configure minicom, start it up with minicom -s to prevent it from\nimmediately attempting to connect to any serial ports.  From here you can\nset the serial device to point to the usb serial port\n(/dev/cu.usbserial-XXXX) and set Hardware Flow Control to Off so that\nyou can send data through the serial port. Save these settings as the default\nand every time you run minicom it’ll start up with those settings and\nimmediately connect to the serial port.\nConclusion\nAnd that's it! I've so far used the above configuration for about a month\nso far with no major problems. Next up on this adventure, I dive deeper\ninto a project which involves sensors, pumps, and even WiFi communication\nfor a more automated home.\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/adventures-in-iot/","title":"Adventures in IoT: Dev Environment"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/adventures-in-rust-cli/":{"body":"My second project in Rust is a little more practical than my first (which\nyou can read here). This project involves creating a\ncommand-line utility that is able to interact with the Bear Writer\napplication, an OS X app that I use for taking notes, writing blogs, and\ngenerally keeping my life organized in a single, cloud-synced place.\n\nBear is a truly wonderful app that lacks a CLI so when I’m in the terminal\nit’s requires tediously switching back and forth between two screens.\nHonestly, it’s not that big of a deal, but why not use it as an excuse to\nbuild a little utility that I can use.\nPlus I thought up a fantastic name for the utility, cub for\nCommand-line Utility for Bear.\nYou can check out the code for this project here.\nWhat this will cover\nHere are the things I cover in this post in case you want to skip around:\n\nUsing clap to read values from the command-line.\nUsing rusqlite to query the Bear note database.\nSome thoughts after I finished the first iteration of the application.\n\nSetting up a CLI\nAfter checking out a couple ways of extracting arguments from the command\nline, I settled on clap mainly due to the ability to\nconfigure the parser using a yaml file. This keeps my rust code focused on\nthe implementation logic of the utility and moves most of the configuration\nboilerplate into a completely separate non-rust file.\nFor a real life example of how this works, below is the configuration I use\nto split the arguments and subcommands with their accompanying\nflags/options:\nname: cub\nversion: \"0.1.0\"\nauthor: Andrew Huynh &lt;a5thuynh@gmail.com&gt;\nabout: Command-line Utility for Bear.\nargs:\n  - db:\n      help: Bear data file to pull data from.\n      short: d\n      global: true\n      takes_value: true\nsubcommands:\n  - ls:\n      about: List notes.\n      args:\n        - all:\n            short: a\n            help: Show *all* notes.\n            conflicts_with: limit\n  - show:\n      about: Show a single note.\n      args:\n        - NOTE:\n            help: Note ID\n            required: true\n            index: 1\n\nThis then enables me to initialize the parser in two very simple lines as seen below:\n#[macro_use]\nextern crate clap;\nuse clap::App;\n\nfn main() {\n    let yaml = load_yaml!(\"cli.yml\");\n    let matches = App::from_yaml(yaml).get_matches();\n    ...do stuff...\n}\n\nIn addition to setting up the subcommands and flags, clap also generates\nuseful documentation that shows up when you run --help.\n\nSpeaking to the Bear\nGreat, now that we have a way to take subcommands and arguments, lets look\ninto how we can list out notes and run some basic queries. The Bear app\nstores the notes and associated metadata in a sqlite database, I’m assuming\ndue to the use of Apple’s CoreData frameworks.\nTo keep things safe, this first version will only do read only actions.\nWith a little poking around I was able to determine that the local storage\nfor note data is under:\n$HOME/Library/Containers/net.shinyfrog.bear/Data/Documents/Application Data\nReverse Engineering the Data Format\nLuckily, if you know your way around sqlite, it’s trivial to look through\nhow the application stores its data. Let's start with determining how notes\nand the associated tags are stored. We can list out all the tables in a\ndatabase file using the .tables command.\n&gt; sqlite3 database.sqlite\nsqlite&gt; .tables\nZSFCHANGE      ZSFLOCATION    ZSFNOTETAG     ZSFURL\nZ_MODELCACHE   ZSFCHANGEITEM  ZSFNOTE        ZSFSTATICNOTE\nZ_5TAGS        Z_PRIMARYKEY   ZSFFOLDER      ZSFNOTEFILE\nZSFTODO        Z_METADATA\nsqlite&gt;\n\nHere we can see some potentially useful tables to rifle through. ZSFNOTE\nlooks the most promising and we can use the .schema command to determine\nthe structure of the table.\nsqlite&gt; .schema ZSFNOTE\nCREATE TABLE ZSFNOTE (\n    Z_PK INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,\n    ...\n    ZARCHIVEDDATE TIMESTAMP,\n    ZCREATIONDATE TIMESTAMP,\n    ...\n    ZSUBTITLE VARCHAR,\n    ZTEXT VARCHAR,\n    ZTITLE VARCHAR,\n    ...\n);\n\nNOTE: I left out some columns to make the schema more readable\nPerfect! This has the entire note text data as well as some useful flags\nfor that particular note that we can use to apply filters to our CLI.\nLooking at the schema of ZSFNOTETAG and Z_5TAGS we also have the\nconnection between notes and tags.\nRunning Queries\nTo connect to the database, I’m using the\nrusqlite framework. Setting up\nrusqlite is very straightforward. Here’s a small example where I connect\nto the database and run a simple select query on the notes table just to\nreally hammer home how simple it is.\nuse rusqlite::{ Connection };\nuse libcub::note::{ Note };\n\nfn connect_to_db(datafile: &amp;str) -&gt; Connection {\n    return Connection::open(datafile).unwrap();\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    let conn = connect_to_db(&lt;path&gt;);\n    let mut stmt = conn.prepare(\"SELECT * FROM ZSFNOTE\").unwrap();\n    let notes = stmt.query_map(&amp;[&amp;val], |row| {\n        Note::from_sql(row)\n    }).unwrap();\n    for note in notes {\n        println!(\"{:?}\", note);\n    }\n}\n\nAnd thats all there is to it!\nTo support things like filtering by different flags. I set up a rust enum\nto represent each filter and modify the query accordingly. For example, when\nI added the filters for archived and trashed notes, this is how the query\nstring was modified:\nfor filter in filters {\n    match filter {\n        NoteStatus::ARCHIVED =&gt; {\n            filter_sql.push(\"ZARCHIVED = 1\")\n        },\n        NoteStatus::TRASHED =&gt; {\n            filter_sql.push(\"ZTRASHED = 1\")\n        },\n        NoteStatus::NORMAL =&gt; {\n            filter_sql.push(\"(ZARCHIVED = 0 AND ZTRASHED = 0)\")\n        },\n    }\n}\n\nEach filter is converted into its equivalent SQL syntax and then added to\na vector of filters. This vector is then later on joined to the query\nstring using a string format.\nformat!(\"{} WHERE {}\", query, filter_sql.join(\" OR \"));\nLearnings and Up Next\nThis was a short weekend(iso) project that was a lot of fun to work on.\nHere are some random learnings that I ran into while working on this:\n\nclap was a pleasure to use and the separate yaml configuration made\nadjusting subcommands and flags a breeze.\nCurrently rusqlite does not support IN queries, such as SELECT * FROM ZSFNOTE WHERE Z_PK IN (&lt;list of numbers) which made me push\nfiltering notes by tag into a later version so I could manually implement\nthat query.\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/adventures-in-rust-cli/","title":"Adventures in Rust: CLI"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/adventures-in-rust/":{"body":"In an effort to do more fun side projects, I've been learning Rust,\na wonderful systems programming language developed by the Mozilla\nFoundation. It's been a while since I've touched a compiled language as my\nday-to-day often deals with Python and Javascript variants. I was inspired\nafter seeing a lot of interesting articles about\nRust usage and decided to dive into learning Rust by creating a very basic 2D\ngame, inspired by the classic Defender arcade game.\n\nNote that to keep things relatively concise this blog post walks through\nthe major portions of the codebase but does skip over some of the\nimplementation details. If you're interested in walking through the code\nyourself, the final result of this blog post is available on here on\nGithub.\nAnd finally, if you're interested in jumping into Rust for yourself, here\nare some resources I found immensely useful:\n\n“The Rust Programming Language” Book (2nd Edition)\nRust Subreddit.\nRust web playground.\n\nGetting Started\nAlright, let's get down to business!\nFirst off, I opted to use a framework geared towards game development\nrather than build a lot of things from scratch and to abstract a lot of the\nOS level windowing and input handling. There is a couple out there that\nhave varying degrees of bells and whistles and in the end I opted to use\nPiston which is being actively developed, has some basic\ndocumentation, and has a modular architecture in case I want to use more\nadvance features later on.\nI began with the Piston \"Getting Started\" example and made\nsome modifications to move much of the game logic to lib.rs.\nBelow is the modified main.rs file where all we do is configure the\nwindow and start the event loop.\nfn main() {\n    // Original Defenders had a resolution of 320x256\n    let mut app = App::new(GraphicsConfig::new(\"Defender\", 960, 768));\n\n\t  // Poll for events from the window.\n    let mut events = Events::new(EventSettings::new());\n    while let Some(e) = events.next(&amp;mut app.window.settings) {\n        // Handle rendering\n        if let Some(r) = e.render_args() {\n            app.render(&amp;r);\n        }\n        // Handle any updates\n        if let Some(u) = e.update_args() {\n            app.update(&amp;u);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNote: There is an App struct that is not present in the \"Getting\nStarted\" example where I move useful game state, such as the square\nposition (x,y) and rotation.\nWhile in lib.rs we have the basic render and update loops to blank out\nthe screen, draw a red square, and then rotate it as seen below.\n// Handle rendering any objects on screen.\npub fn render(&amp;mut self, args: &amp;RenderArgs) {\n    // Get the location of the \"player\" we want to render.\n    let rotation = self.rotation;\n    let x = self.x;\n    let y = self.y;\n\n    // Create a little square and render it on screen.\n    let square = rectangle::square(0.0, 0.0, 50.0);\n    self.window.gl.draw(args.viewport(), |c, gl| {\n        // Clear the screen.\n        clear(BLACK, gl);\n        // Place object on screen\n        let transform = c.transform.trans(x, y)\n            // Handle any rotation\n            .rot_rad(rotation)\n            // Center object on coordinate.\n            .trans(-25.0, -25.0);\n        // Draw a box rotating around the middle of the screen.\n        rectangle(RED, square, transform, gl);\n    });\n}\n\n// Update any animation, etc.\npub fn update(&amp;mut self, args: &amp;UpdateArgs) {\n    // Rotate 2 radians per second.\n    self.rotation += 2.0 * args.dt;\n}\n\nLets cargo run to build and run the project and see what we get! If\nyou're following along, you should a nice black screen with a rotating red\nsquare in the middle.\n\nWith the basic rendering and animation functionality set up, I moved onto\ncapturing input from the keyboard and translating that to movement on\nscreen.\nGetting Input\nPiston's event loop makes it incredibly easy to poll for input\nevents. In the game, we're interested in keyboard presses that would lead\nto our space ship moving around or firing a projectile at the enemy while\neverything else we can safely ignore. I modified the event loop from the\nPiston example to listen for and process keyboard events as we see below:\npub fn input(&amp;mut self, button: &amp;Button) {\n    if let Button::Keyboard(key) = *button {\n        match key {\n            // For simplicity's sake we directly\n            // modify the player struct here.\n            Key::Up =&gt; self.player.y -= UNIT_MOVE,\n            Key::Down =&gt; self.player.y += UNIT_MOVE,\n            Key::Left =&gt; self.player.x -= UNIT_MOVE,\n            Key::Right =&gt; self.player.x += UNIT_MOVE,\n            Key::Space =&gt; (), // Fire bullets!\n            _ =&gt; (), // Ignore all other\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNote: In the final code, this input loop is a little more complicated since\nI listen for events on button press and release, but the concept stays the same.\nRendering Enemies &amp; Other Objects\nAs we render more and more objects on screen, I thought it best to\nstandardize some of the functionality we want to exist in each drawable\nobject. This also happened to be a great place to start playing around with\nRust traits! Below we have a basic GameObject trait stating\nthat every object which implements that trait must have a render function\nand optionally an update function.\n// Every object that needs to be rendered on screen.\npub trait GameObject {\n    fn render(&amp;self, ctxt: &amp;Context, gl: &amp;mut GlGraphics);\n    fn update(&amp;mut self, _: f64) {\n        // By default do nothing in the update function\n    }\n}\n\n+++\nWhat are traits?\nTraits in Rust allow us to abstract shared behavior that different types\nmay have in common. For instance, rather then make a single struct with all\nattributes that may or may not be used when representing the Player and\nEnemy objects, we can extract these attributes out into their own structs\nand only implement the shared behavior amongst each object as a trait. For example,\nfrom the Rust standard library things such as how to display an object as a\nstring are implemented as traits.\nTraits also simplifies the logic that occurs in the shared behavior. For\ninstance, in our non-trait example perhaps we want to render enemies in a\ncertain way and must check a flag to see if the object is an enemy or not.\nTraits eliminates this, allowing us to have separate render logic for the\nenemy while still having compile time checks for types that are expected to\nhave this trait.\n+++\nWith this GameObject trait, we can move the render and update logic\nfor the player into models/player.rs. This simplifies the main render and\nupdate loop in lib.rs and sets the stage for future drawable objects such\nas enemies, bullets, and other things.\nimpl GameObject for Player {\n    fn render(&amp;self, ctxt: &amp;Context, gl: &amp;mut GlGraphics) {\n        // Render the player as a little square\n        let square = rectangle::square(0.0, 0.0, self.size);\n        // Set the x/y coordinate for \"spaceship\"\n        let transform = ctxt.transform.trans(self.x, self.y)\n        // Draw the player on screen.\n        rectangle(color::RED, square, transform, gl);\n    }\n\n    fn update(&amp;mut self, dt: f64) {\n        // Handle updates here. Adjusting animation/movement/etc.\n    }\n}\n\nIf you're interested in seeing how enemies and bullets are rendered and\nanimated, check out the models/enemy.rs and models/bullet.rs. At the\ntime of writing, enemies are completely harmless and only move in random\ndirections. Bullets are a little more complicated as they have a lifetime\nvalue that determines when we remove them from screen.\nHandling Collisions\nAt this point, we should be able to render any sort of object on screen. If\nthe objective of the game is for the player to clear the screen of enemies\nusing bullets, we'll need to detect whether a bullet has in fact collided\nwith an enemy and handle that event accordingly. I added some additional\nfunctions to the GameObject trait to handle all of this logic. In the\nend, the only thing each object on screen needs to know is its current\nposition and the radius of its bounding circle.\nBelow is the snippet from the GameObject trait that handles collision\ndetection:\nfn collides(&amp;self, other: &amp;GameObject) -&gt; bool {\n    // Two circles intersect if the distance between their centers is\n    // between the sum and the difference of their radii.\n    let x2 = self.position().x - other.position().x;\n    let y2 = self.position().y - other.position().y;\n    let sum = x2.powf(2.0) + y2.powf(2.0);\n\n    let r_start = self.radius() - other.radius();\n    let r_end = self.radius() + other.radius();\n\n    return r_start.powf(2.0) &lt;= sum &amp;&amp; sum &lt;= r_end.powf(2.0);\n}\n\n// Use to determine position of the object\nfn position(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Position;\nfn radius(&amp;self) -&gt; f64;\n\nTo run the actual collision check, we loop through each bullet and enemy\nduring the update loop and check to see if they've collided. If so, we\nremove both from the screen and update our score.\nfor bullet in self.bullets.iter_mut() {\n    // Did bullet collide with any enemies\n    for enemy in self.enemies.iter_mut() {\n        if bullet.collides(enemy) {\n            // Setting the bullet ttl will remove it from screen.\n            bullet.ttl = 0.0;\n            // Setting the enemy health to 0 will remove it from screen.\n            enemy.health = 0;\n            // Keep track of kills\n            self.score += 10;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd there it is in action!\n\nAll that's missing are explosions and bits of green square scattered\nacross the screen.\nKeeping Score &amp; End Game\nIn the previous section, you'll notice that every time a player hits an\nenemy square, we update the score. Currently there is no way for the player\nto know what score they have and no way for the game to end. Let's render\nthe score on screen and handle an end-game status.\nRendering text ended up taking a huge chunk of my time to figure out.\nMostly because some of the documentation and example projects using text\nrender code were out of date. In the end, I was able to dive into the\nsource code for the piston2d-opengl_graphics library to figure out the\nexact incantation. In the end, it was a simple two lines of code to load\nthe font we want and use it to render the score.\nFirst and foremost, we need to load the font we want to use. I chose a fantastic old school IBM font to really accentuate the nostalgic look.\nlet glyph_cache = GlyphCache::new(\n    \"./assets/fonts/PxPlus_IBM_VGA8.ttf\",\n    (),\n    TextureSettings::new()\n).expect(\"Unable to load font\");\n\nAnd finally in our render loop, draw the current score on screen.\ntext::Text::new_color(::color::WHITE, 16)\n    .draw(\n        format!(\"Score: {}\", score).as_str(),\n        glyph_cache,\n        &amp;DrawState::default(),\n        c.transform.trans(0.0, 16.0),\n        gl\n    ).unwrap();\n\nNote: In the final code, I created some utility functions to help render the\ntext. You can find these in gfx/utils.rs\nTo detect end game states, I add a GameStatus enum with different states\nand check for the appropriate status at the start of the render and update\nloops. For example, in the snippet below we check that we've reached either\na GameStatus::Died or GameStatus::Win and render the appropriate\nmessage to show the user.\nlet viewport = [size.width as f64, size.height as f64];\nmatch state.game_status {\n    GameStatus::Died =&gt; {\n        draw_center(\"YOU DIED!\", 32, viewport, gc, &amp;c, gl);\n        return;\n    },\n    GameStatus::Win =&gt; {\n        draw_center(\"YOU WIN!\", 32, viewport, gc, &amp;c, gl);\n        return;\n    },\n    _ =&gt; (),\n}\nFinal Result\nFinally, here is the final result!\n\nRunning into enemies will insta-kill the player and shooting down the harmless\nwiggly green squares leads to winning the game. While a far cry from the Defender\narcade game, we have all the workings of a basic 2d game that I set out to build\nas an excuse to deep dive into Rust.\nAppendix: Notes &amp; Learnings\nSince this was my first dive into a full project in Rust, I took notes on\nwhat worked and what didn't work throughout the entire dev process.\n\nRust is familiar but different (in a good way).\n\nIt's been a while since I've thought about pointers and references, heap\nallocation vs. stack allocation, and even types but jumping into Rust felt\nreally good. It brings a lot of familiar syntax from C-based languages\n(such as structs, references, and pointers) while\nalso introducing a lot of compelling new functionality such as\nclosures, traits, and lifetimes.\n\nCargo is an excellent tool.\n\nCargo is Rust's package manager that is a sort of mixture between\ntraditionally package managers and a Makefile. Cargo can handle\ndependencies while also building and running your code as well. There is\nalso a flourishing community of third-party subcommands that do\neverything from watching for changes and auto-building to auditing for\nsecurity vulnerabilities.\n\nRust game dev is still nascent.\n\nWhile Piston made a lot of things straightforward to use,\nthe framework is not 100% stable quite yet. There's still plenty\nof development going on that may create breaking changes from version\nto version. However, it's exciting to get up and running as quickly as\nI could in a scripting language such as Python.\nEdited (2018-02-08): Added missing links in appendix.\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/adventures-in-rust/","title":"Adventures in Rust: A Basic 2D Game"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/chip8-emulator/":{"body":"What started as an attempt to demonstrate how interrupts and grayscale\nrendering works on the TI series graphing calculators turned into a\nfull-blown attempt at writing an emulator that would be runnable in a\nmodern browser using a combination of Rust 🦀 and\nWebAssembly 🕸. The idea came to me while walking through the\nRust + WebAssembly tutorial, where I realized that many of the\nsame abstractions could apply to an emulated system.\n\nI should note before you get any further that this is not a full guide to\nwriting an emulator in Rust. I just wanted to document some interesting\nimplementation details during my implementation, but this should (hopefully) act\nas a short “Getting Started” guide to point you in the right direction of your\nown emulator or if you just wanted to see what a Rust + WebAssembly project\nlooks like.\nLet's Play\nI've embedded the emulator below so that you can try it out before reading\nany further. The keyboard for the CHIP-8 is represented by the 4x4 grid\nbelow.\nNormal Keyboard      CHIP8 Keyboard\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | -&gt; | 1 | 2 | 3 | C |\n| Q | W | E | R | -&gt; | 4 | 5 | 6 | D |\n| A | S | D | F | -&gt; | 7 | 8 | 9 | E |\n| Z | X | C | V | -&gt; | A | 0 | B | F |\n\nJust select one of the ROMs from the dropdown menu, hit the play button\nand it'll start the emulator.\n\n\nCHIP-8: Hello Emulator\nTo dip my toes into emulator development, I decided to start small.\nCHIP-8 is often considered the \"Hello World\" equivalent of\nemulator projects due to its simplicity, with only 35 instructions, simple\nkeyboard input, and simple sound management.\nThe CHIP-8 was never actually a real chip/system and was developed to be more\nof a virtual machine that could be run on different microcomputers at the\ntime. It nevertheless captures all the abstractions required for other\nemulator projects and offers a friendly dip into the emulator development\nworld. Having existing emulators to compare with was also tremendously\nhelpful to understand certain subtleties of the implementation.\nAdditionally, there are also tons of great resources that fully describe\nthe instruction set and even walk you through an implementation:\n\n/r/EmuDev Subreddit\n\nTremendously helpful just looking at old posts and seeing what others have\ndone.\n\n\nCowgod's Chip-8 Technical Reference\n\nPretty much my go-to reference for each opcode that is implemented in the\nproject.\n\n\nHow to write an emulator (CHIP-8 Interpreter)\n\nI didn't delve into this blog post too much, but I did use it to compare\ncertain implementation details that were giving me trouble.\n\n\n\nSetup\nIf you've followed the Rust-Wasm Book tutorial already, the following\ncommands will look familiar. I started the project by generating the\nproject folder with everything necessary to get started:\n# Generates the rust project folder\n&gt; cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template emu-project\n# Go into the project directory to initialize the javascript project\n&gt; cd emu-project\n&gt; npm init wasm-app www\n\nKeeping with the statically typed language theme, I wanted to use\nTypeScript for as much of the browser code as possible,\nwhich required a couple tweaks to the generated project:\n\nAdded a tsconfig.json file to configure the TypeScript compiler.\nUpdated the package.json file to include TypeScript dev dependencies.\nUpdated the webpack.config.js file to compile TypeScript and hot module\nreload when it detects any changes.\n\nAs for the generated javascript files output by wasm-pack, I couldn't\nquite figure out how to also convert bootstrap.js and index.js files to\nTypeScript so these are kept the same and will import the rest of the\napplication.\nWhat do we need to emulate?\nOutside of the instructions, we'll also need to emulate essential parts of\nthe CHIP-8 system that are required to run a program.\n\nVarious registers\n\n15 8-bit general purpose registers.\n1 8-bit carry register used as a “carry” flag during arithmetic.\n1 8-bit stack pointer (often referred to as the SP register).\n1 16-bit program counter (often referred to as the PC register).\n1 16-bit index register.\n\n\n4096 bytes of memory.\n2048 bytes to represent the display, creating a 64 x 32 pixel display.\n\nThis actually only needs to be represented as a 0 or 1, so an array\nof booleans would work as well.\n\n\nA sound &amp; delay timer.\n\nMost if not all of these can easily be represented by arrays of the the\naforementioned types, all of which can be unsigned integers.\nExecution Loop\nAt a high level, for successful emulation of the CHIP-8 system we want to\ncorrectly imitate every cycle of the CPU, keep track of any changes to the\ndisplay/memory/registers, and finally handle any keyboard input.\nIf we had a function that would handle each tick of the CPU, it would\nlook something very similar to the following:\nfn tick(&amp;mut self) {\n    // 1. Find the opcode pointed to by the `PC` register.\n    let opcode = self.fetch()\n    // 2. Fetch and decode the opcode.\n    // 3. Execute the opcode &amp; update the `PC`.\n    self.execute(opcode);\n}\n\nThis simple execution loop will form the basis for the rest of emulation\ncode. Most, if not all, of our logic will happen inside the execute\nfunction, where each opcode will be decoded and applied to the\nregisters/memory/display.\nWhat happens during fetch()?\nAt a very high level, fetch returns a 16-bit instruction pointed to by the\nPC register and increments the PC. The only “gotcha” here would how\ninstructions are stored in memory, most-significant byte\nfirst. Taking this into account, the code to grab the opcode in the correct\nbyte order would like the following:\nlet opcode = u16::from(mem[pc]) &lt;&lt; 8 | u16::from(mem[pc + 1]);\nWhat happens during execute()?\nLike mentioned before, execute() is where the majority of the logic for\nthe emulator will reside. In the case of my implementation, I break the\nopcodes into different prefixes (0x1000, 0x2000, etc) and implemented the\nlogic for each corresponding prefix. For example, lets take the simple 0x00E0\nopcode that is used to completely clear the screen:\n// First, we grab the first bytes of the opcode as a prefix\nlet prefix = opcode &amp; 0xF000;\n// Grab the lower two bytes.\nlet lower = (opcode &amp; 0x00FF) as u8;\nmatch prefix {\n    // Match and handle 0x0xxx opcodes\n    0x0000 =&gt; {\n        match lower {\n            // Clear display.\n            0xE0 =&gt; {\n                for idx in 0..DISPLAY_SIZE {\n                    self.display[idx] = 0;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    },\n    // handle 0x1xxx opcodes\n    0x1000 =&gt; {},\n    // etc.\n    ...,\n    _ =&gt; log!(\"Unknown opcode {:#X}\", opcode)\n}\n\nThe opcode prefixes can be grabbed using a little bit-slinging magic that\nyou see at the top of the code example: opcode &amp; 0xF000. This bitwise AND\noperation will only return the very first byte of the opcode. This made it\neasy to write tests for each opcode, since instructions in the same prefix\ntend to be related to each other.\nRendering the Display\nWhile most of the opcodes implemented in execute() tend to be only a\nhandful of lines, the most complex of the opcodes is used to draw sprites\nto the screen. This single instruction handles reading a sprite stored in\nmemory, xor-ing it to display memory. Additionally, a flag is also set if\nany pixels are erased, a feature is that is often used in programs for\ncollision detection.\nThe 64x32 pixel display has a coordinate system that starts at the top left\nand extends downwards:\n\n┌─────────────────┐\n│(0,0)         (63,0)│\n│                    │\n│(0,3)        (63,31)│\n└─────────────────┘\n\n\nSprites that cross horizontal/vertical boundaries are wrapped to the other\nside. For example, if we have a sprite that starts at (63,0), the pixel\nat (63,0) will be set on and then wrapped around to (0,0), (1,0),\netc.\nHandling Input\nThe CHIP-8 system uses a hex keypad, which is a little odd but can be\nmapped easily to any 4x4 set of keys on modern day keyboards. All that\nneeds to be tracked is whether key is pressed and whether the key was the\nlast pressed key. This is accomplished by adding an event listener for the\nkeyup and keydown events, where the key press is sent to the emulator\nfor handling.\nHere is an example of the handleKeyPress code for both the typescript\nand rust side. The typescript side needs a key map thats not shown\nto map the pressed key code to the corresponding emulated key, discarding\nall other key presses.\npublic handleKeyPress(ev: KeyboardEvent) {\n    if (ev.keyCode in KEY_MAP) {\n        this.engine.key_press(KEY_MAP[ev.keyCode]);\n    }\n}\n\nAnd for the rust side, we keep track of the currently pressed key as well\nas setting the key to pressed until we receive a release event for that key.\npub fn key_press(&amp;mut self, key: Key) {\n    self.current_key = Some(key);\n    self.keys[key as usize] = true;\n}\nUp Next\nAnd that's pretty much it! I could've gone into far much depth into things\nlike the opcodes or perhaps the display rendering, but I leave that up as\nan exercise for the reader. All the code for this emulator will be publicly\navailable along with the research and ROMs used during its development.\nNote that at the time of this writing there are still currently some bugs\nwith the more complex ROMs and potentially some speed improvements that could\nbe done. I plan on fixing up the last remaining bugs w/ the emulator and\nimplementing the basic sound handler.\nThe next emulator added to the mix will probably be a Z80 or NES emulator,\na much larger emulation implementation but should be able to reuse many of\nthe components created for this project.\n\nYou can follow progress on my emulator(s) development here.\n\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/chip8-emulator/","title":"Rust & Wasm CHIP-8 Emulator"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/tbt-building-ti86-apps/":{"body":"Through some backups, I recently re-discovered a folder with some high\nschool/college projects that I thought had been lost to the sands of time.\nOne of them was an early attempt at a small RPG written in Z80 assembly for\nthe TI-86 graphing calculator.

The TI-83/4/5/6\ngraphing calculator series used the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, an\n8-bit based CPU introduced by Zilog back in 1976 and, remarkably, is\nstill in production to this day for many embedded/consumer devices\n(including those aforementioned graphing calculators). The Z80 was software\ncompatible with the previously popular Intel 8080 but extended and\nenhanced it in a couple important ways that propelled it to\nits eventual popularity. Outside of the TI graphing calculators it was used\nin such devices as the Gameboy and Gameboy Color.\nCompiling the Source Code\nDue to its popularity, there are a lot of tools out there for the Z80,\nspanning decades of work. It took a little digging around but I was able to\nfind an assembler that worked on OSX (and other Unix based systems) called\nzasm that is still being actively worked on today! It’s available as a\nbinary download or if you’re more homebrew inclined, I added a\nformula to my personal homebrew repository that makes\ninstalling it a cinch.\nbrew tap a5huynh/brew\nbrew install zasm\n\nWith zasm in hand, lets run the compiler on the source code and see what happens:\n&gt; zasm src/MiniRPG.asm -o dist\n\nin file MiniRPG.asm:\n1: #include \"ti86.inc\"\n   ^ file \"src/ti86.inc\" could not be read:\n     No such file or directory: file = \"src/ti86.inc\" (fd108)\n\nassembled file: MiniRPG.asm\n    54 lines, 1 pass, 0.0044 sec.\n    1 error\n\nWell, nobody said it was going to be easy.\nThe Case of the Missing Includes\nIt turns out I had been using an include file, ti86.inc, which I had not\nbacked up with the rest of my source code. These include files define RAM\nand ROM functions/memory locations so that instead of writing a function\ncall like call 4AB1h, we can write call _runIndicOff. There are also\nconstants for things like different key presses and commonly used memory\nlocations.\nTo find this missing file, I went to the incredibly useful\nticalc.org file archives to see if there are include files I\ncould use and stumbled upon the Ultimate TI-86 Include File. A\ncursory look through the file showed me that it had all the missing symbols\nthat the assembler would be expecting from an include file.\nLet’s run it again and see what happens:\n&gt; zasm src/MiniRPG.asm -o dist/main.86p\nassembled file: MiniRPG.asm\n    3332 lines, 2 passes, 0.0542 sec.\n    no errors\n\nPerfect! Looks like zasm was able to assemble the source code without any\nissues and created a small binary. Now that we have a binary to work with,\nthe next step is figuring out how to run the program.\nRunning the Code\nSince I no longer have a TI-86 calculator on hand, the next best thing\nwould be to find an emulator. Looking through the\nticalc.org website, I was able to find archives for\nthe cross-platform emulator Wabbit that supports emulation of\nthe TI-83/4/5/6 series of calculators. It's a little over the top with a\nfull-on skin of the TI-86 calculator and forces you to actually click on\nthe image to type things out, but it works nonetheless.\n\nLoading the output from zasm into the emulator lead to nothing. Turns\nout, it was expecting a specific file format for the assembly program to be\npacked into before it could successfully transfer and run the application.\nThe 86p File Format\nThis lead to a 🌟fun 🌟 detour through the 86p file format, a proprietary file\nformat for different equations/variables/graphs/programs for the TI-86.\nThere are no existing tools (to my knowledge) that allow you to pack/unpack\nprograms in this file format, so I whipped up a python script based on the\nformat specifications to analyze existing TI-86 binaries and a packer to\npack the final output of the zasm assembler into something that can be\ntransferred and run by the TI-86 emulator.\n\nYou can check out the pack &amp; unpacker code here\n\nFor example, analyzing the final output of assembled and packed game would look\nlike so:\n&gt; python scripts/unpack86.py dist/MiniRPG.86p\n-- Header --\nSignature:      0x2a2a544938362a2a | **TI86**\nSignature:      0x1a0a00\nComment:        Packed by pack86.py\nData Size:      4322 bytes\n\n-- Data --\nData Header:    (12, 4306, 18, 7, b'MiniRPG\\x00', 4306)\nProgram Len:    4302\nProgram Type:   0x8e28\nChecksum (in file):     0x8bf7\nChecksum (calculated):  0x8bf7\n\nThis enabled me to dig into valid 86p files that I knew worked on the\nemulator and compare that with output I created with my packing script.\nThe 86p file format is broken into 3 parts. There’s much more detailed\ndocumentation available from ticalc.org, but I thought it’d be fun to break\ndown a real-life example. Let’s first take a look at the header section:\n2A 2A 54 49 38 36 2A 2A     **TI86**\n               1A 0A 00     Magic Number\n             &lt;42 bytes&gt;     Comment\n              &lt;2 bytes&gt;     Length of the data section\n\nThe header always starts off with the same 11 bytes, **TI86** followed by\nthe magic number 0x1a0a00. This is followed by a comment section of\n42 bytes, ASCII encoded. If the comment is less than 42 characters long,\nthe rest of the space is padded by null (0x00) bytes. And lastly, we have\n2 bytes which indicates how large the “data” section will be.\nThe data section contains another header and embedded in it the program\nitself (which itself also has a header). The header of the data section is\na bit more complex so I’ll break it down using a table. Note that the data\nsection can also be used to store variables, equations, graphs, etc.\n# of BytesDescription\n2Always 0x0c00 (12).\n2Length of the program data.\n1Data Type ID.\n1Length, in characters, of the variable name.\n8Variable name, padded w/ space (0x20) or null (0x00).\n2Length of the program data (again).\n\nBreaking down a real-life example generated by my packing code:\n                  0C 00     Magic Number\n                  58 05     Lenght of the program data.\n                     12     Data Type (Program)\n                     07     Length of the variable name\n4D 69 6E 69 52 50 47 00     MiniRPG (variable name)\n                  58 05     Length of the program data\n\nFinally the program itself, which itself has a small header that encodes\nhow large the ASM code is and the type of program. Since this file format\nis also used to backup programs you may have written on the calculator, the\nprogram type are different variations of ASM and TI-BASIC identifiers.\n                  58 05     Program length.\n                  8E 28     Program type.\n                  .. ..     &lt;program in ASM&gt;\nPutting it All Together\nAfter all that 🌟fun 🌟 research into the file format and a little trial and\nerror I was able to finally create a working toolchain that leads from\nsource code to running program:\n\nAssemble the source code,\nPack the generated binary into the appropriate file format,\nTransfer the file over to the TI-86 emulator,\nAnd finally run the program!\n\nBelow I embedded a video of the game running in all its full glory on the\nWabbit emulator. There are a couple visual glitches and you can't really do\nanything except walk around the scene I created.\n\n\nNothing to phone home about, but I’m still impressed I was able to get a\nrudimentary rendering system and NPC conversational system together in Z80\nassembly.\nFor Next Time\nThis was a fun nostalgia trip but now that I have a working toolchain it\nalso gave me a bunch of ideas I want to try out for a more in-depth dive into\nZ80 assembly.\n\nGrayscale rendering\n\nIf you take a look at a closeup gif of the running game in Wabbit, you'll\nsee that it oddly flashes due to the grayscale rendering, as seen below:\n\nThe TI-86 itself only renders in black and white and to accomplish\ngrayscale rendering requires a bit of a hack where for each screen refresh\nwe swap in/out screen memory to simulate grayscale. This would normally\nwork on the actual hardware but the emulator is unable to correctly handle\nthis particular method. There is another method that is supposed to be\nfaster, more reliable, and should work with the emulator that I intend of\nimplementing for the next article.\n\nRunning on actual hardware\n\nUnfortunately TI-86 graphic calculators have been discontinued and my old\ncalculator has been lost to time. I plan on finding a working version to see\nif this will work on actual hardware as well.\n\nRun on different hardware\n\nDue to the popularity of the Z80, it'd be interesting to see if I could get\na basic version of this \"game\" running on other platforms, such as the GameBoy\nor GameBoy Color as well.\n\nCompilation from a different language\n\nAs 🌟fun 🌟 as it is working on Z80 assembly, it'd be interesting to see if I\ncan build out a toolchain in C/Haskell/TypeScript/Rust that would be able to\ncompile down to Z80 assembly.\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2018/tbt-building-ti86-apps/","title":"tbt: Building TI-86 apps on OSX"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2019/":{"body":"","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2019/","title":""},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2019/isometric-rotation/":{"body":"I've been working on a game side-project for the past year as a fun way to\nreally deep dive into Rust, Amethyst, and different\ngame dev topics such as AI, pathfinding, shaders, etc. The game utilizes an\nisometric 2.5D view much like SimCity 3000 or Civilization, all from\npre-rendered sprites.\n\nAs I was working on the map generation and rendering, I found a couple\ntutorials that went through a basic isometric projection with tiles, but\nnothing that did it in a way that was generalizable to different view\npoints. Due to the progress I've made thus far with my own game, I decided\nto do a little writeup (with examples!) to showcase how to go from a grid\nof points to an isometric projection with different orientations.\nBelow I have a full example that has been rebuilt in WebGL with different toggles\nto visualize each step of the transformation.\n\n\nThe code for the example is available here.\n\nFrom grid to projection\nStandard isometric projection has it where if we started with the front\nface of an object, it would be rotated 45 degrees around the vertical axis\nand then approximately 35 degrees around the horizontal axis. After these\ntransformations, the objects should look roughly like the different shapes\nin the image below:\n\nExample of different 3D shapes isometrically projected. Source: Wikipedia\nBefore we began, some assumptions:\n\nTiles will be sprites that are already rendered with the isometric look\n(à la SimCity 3000).\nThe tile grid is represented by a 2D array.\nThe camera being used is an orthographic camera.\n\nAssuming the grid to be in Euclidean space where (0,0) is\nat the bottom left, the 2D array of tiles we'll be using in our example\nwill be represented roughly like the code snippet below:\nenum Tiles = {\n    GRASS,\n    DIRT\n};\n\nlet map = [\n    // row 0, col 0; row 0, col 1, etc.\n    [Tiles.GRASS, Tiles.GRASS, ...]\n    ...\n];\n\nWe can loop through each row and column and render each tile of the grid at\ntheir respective (col, row) point to get something basic on screen.\nlet geometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry( 32, 32 );\n\nlet even = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0xff0000 });\nlet odd = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({ color: 0x00ff00 });\n\nfor (let y = 0; y &lt; grid.length; y++) {\n    for (let x = 0; x &lt; grid[y].length; x++) {\n        let tile = new THREE.Mesh(\n            geometry,\n            (x + y) % 2 ? even : odd\n        );\n\n        tile.position.x = x;\n        tile.position.y = y;\n\n        scene.add(tile);\n    }\n}\n\nWhen the above code is run (see the repo for the full code snippet), we'll\nget something that looks roughly like so:\n\nThe example grid rendered with 32x32 width tiles at each respective\n(col, row) point\nAs you can see, without any modification to how we place the tiles\neverything will overlap with each other. To go from this to the isometric\nprojection we want, we're going to have to apply a series of\ntransforms that will translate, scale, and rotate the\ntiles to their correct positions.\n🤔 What are transforms?\nIn linear algebra, a transform or transformation matrix refers to a linear\nmapping between some set of points to another set of points. Typically,\nthese linear transformations can be composed (i.e. applied one after\nanother through multiplication) and inverted (e.g. to map a point back to\nsome original grid).\nIn computer graphics, there are certain matrices that can be used to apply\na rotation, scaling, or translation. It is with these matrices that we'll\nbegin our journey towards the final isometric projection.\nApplying the transforms\nSince the sprites being used are already pre-rendered the isometric projection.\nWe only need to apply the following transforms:\n\nTranslating the grid such that the origin is in the center of the grid.\nScaling the grid to match the sprite size.\nRotating the grid around the vertical axis by 45 degrees.\n\n\nToggle between a combination of the 3 transformations in the full example at the\nbeginning of the post to visualize how each transform affects the final tile\nplacement.\n\n\nAbove is an example of scaling the grid to the correct tile size, with the\ntiles attached\n\nAnd here is the scaled grid after we rotate grid by 45 degree and the scale\nthe grid so that the tiles overlap each other correctly.\nRotating to different view points\nArmed with this knowledge, rotating the view for each different\norientations of the grid is as easy as applying another rotation transform\nbefore we convert the grid into the isometric projection.\nIf we intend to mimic the rotation of SimCity 3000, there are only\nfour set rotations, one for each corner of the map. This means from our\ninitial view we will either be rotating 90 degrees clockwise, 90 degrees\ncounter clockwise, or 180 degrees.\nIn matrix form, a rotation matrix would look like so:\n$$\nR = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta) &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta) &amp; \\cos(\\theta) \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nApplied to some point (x, y):\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\cos(\\theta) &amp; -\\sin(\\theta) \\\\\n\\sin(\\theta) &amp; \\cos(\\theta)\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx \\\\\ny \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\nAnd multiplied out:\n$$\nx' = x \\cos(\\theta) - y \\sin(\\theta) \\\\\ny' = x \\sin(\\theta) + y \\cos(\\theta)\n$$\nNow in code, this would look like so for some angle rot:\nlet cos_rot = Math.cos(rot);\nlet sin_rot = Math.sin(rot);\n\nlet rx = (cx * cos_rot) - (cy * sin_rot);\nlet ry = (cx * sin_rot) + (cy * cos_rot);\n\nFor each rotation event, all we need to do is update the rot angle that is\nused to rotate the initial view and update the placement of each tile. As long\nas we have an idea of how large our grid will be, we can apply these transformations\nno matter where we're viewing the grid and have the terrain correctly rotate at the\nlocation we're viewing.\nPutting it all together\nCombining the rotation with the earlier scaling and isometric projection, we get\nthe following code:\n// Center grid on the origin\nlet cx = x - GRID_WIDTH;\nlet cy = y - GRID_HEIGHT;\n\n// Rotate around new origin\nlet cos_rot = Math.cos(rot);\nlet sin_rot = Math.sin(rot);\n\nlet rx = (cx * cos_rot) - (cy * sin_rot);\nlet ry = (cx * sin_rot) + (cy * cos_rot);\n\n// Scale and rotate one last time to get into iso view.\n// NOTE: Since a rotation of 45 degrees makes it so\n// sin = cos = 0.707, I factor out the value since all\n// it's doing is scaling the grid down.\nlet px = (rx - ry) * TILE_WIDTH / 2\nlet py = (rx + ry) * TILE_HEIGHT / 2;\nlet pz = -(rx + ry);\n\nreturn [px, py, pz];\n\nAnd there you have it! We've built an isometric view that also allows us to\nrotate everything however we please.\n","id":"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2019/isometric-rotation/","title":"Rotating an isometric projection"},"https://a5huynh.github.io/posts/2019/poisson-disk-sampling/":{"body":"\"Blue noise\" is a term used in computer graphics to describe\nnoise that is uniformly distributed. It is often used in\nprocedural generation techniques to place objects during terrain generation\nthat require a roughly even distribution across a landscape. This post will go\ninto an implementation of Poisson Disk sampling, a super straightforward\nblue noise generator that I've been using on recent projects. 😄\n\n\nHint: refresh to generate more points!\nSee my repo for the full source code here\n\nFirst off, why would we use blue noise versus normal random number generation? If we\ncompare randomly generated points vs points generated via a blue noise function, we’d\nsee something like the two images below.\n\nRandom number generation, generated using Math.random()\n\nBlue noise, generated using poisson disk sampling\nWe can see that points generated by the blue noise are able to maintain a minimum\ndistance from other points, creating a randomly generated yet more natural look and\nfeel when compared to points generated by random number generation. This is no fault\nof the algorithm used in the random number generator, there are just no guarantees on\nhow evenly distributed the points will be.\nPoisson Disk Sampling\nThe blue noise example above was generated using the algorithm presented in\n\"Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions\". The\nalgorithm is linear w/ respect to the number of points generated (i.e.\nfast 🚀!), easy to understand, and easy to implement so let’s dive in!\nAlgorithm input\nThe poisson disk sampler requires only a couple parameters to get started.\n\nFirst we need \\(n\\), the domain in which the numbers will be generated (i.e. 2D\nspace or 3D space). For the sake of simplicity, we’ll assume that all\npoints will be generated in 2D space, setting \\(n = 2\\).\nThe minimum distance \\(r\\) between samples.\nA constant \\(k\\), the number of samples to choose before rejection.\n\nConverting this into rust, we'll get the the following:\nstruct PoissonDisk {\n    pub minimum_distance: usize,\n    pub num_samples: usize,\n}\n\nimpl PoissonDisk {\n    pub fn new(r: usize, k: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        PoissonDisk {\n            minimum_distance: r,\n            num_samples: k,\n        }\n    }\n}\nKeeping track of sampled points\nAs part of the initialization process, we'll need to create a grid that is\nused to store sampled points and to speed up spatial searches. The size of\neach cell in the grid is directly related to the radius \\(r\\) and the\ndomain \\(n\\). In the case of a 2D grid for our example implementation, each\ncell is bounded by \\(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) so that each grid cell will\ncontain at most a single sample.\nTo understand why we use \\(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\) as the cell size, the insight\nlies in the fact that we want each cell to hold at most one point. So what is\nthe longest possible distance between two points in adjacent cells? The worst case\nwould be two points on opposite ends of the cell diagonal. Since this diagonal should\nnever exceed \\(r\\), we can use some geometry to solve the length of the sides:\n\\begin{align}\nx^2 + x^2 = r^2\\\n2x^2 = r^2\\\nx^2 = \\frac{r^2}{2}\\\nx = \\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\\n\\end{align}\nGeneralizing this to the domain \\(n\\) we see how the original formulation\ncomes out to be \\(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)!\nIn our rust implementation, we’ll represent the grid as a\nVec&lt;Option&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;&gt;. Each cell can either be None or the\nsampled point (usize, usize). Building on the example code we had before,\nthe struct and new function should now look like below:\nstruct PoissonDisk {\n    ..., // fields from before\n    width: usize,\n    height: usize,\n    cell_size: f64,\n    grid_width: f64,\n    grid_height: f64,\n    grid: Vec&lt;Option&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;&gt;,\n    samples: Vec&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;,\n}\n\nimpl PoissonDisk {\n    pub fn new(w: usize, h: usize, r: usize, k: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        let cell_size = r as f64 / (2.0 as f64).sqrt();\n        let grid_width = (w as f64 / cell_size).ceil() + 1.0;\n        let grid_height = (j as f64 / cell_size).ceil() + 1.0;\n\n        PoissonDisk {\n            ...,\n            width: w,\n            height: h,\n            cell_size, grid_width, grid_height,\n            grid: vec![None; (grid_width * grid_height) as usize],\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nNext, we’ll create a utility function to insert new points into the grid\nsince it involves a bit of math each time. We need to determine which cell\nin the grid to place a point, so we’ll scale the point to determine the\ngrid coordinates by dividing the point coordinates by the cell_size and\ncalculate the index into the grid array. Now every time we generate a new\npoint, we can simply call self.insert_point(new_point) to add the point\nto the grid.\nfn insert_point(&amp;mut self, point: (usize, usize)) {\n    // Calculate the (x, y) coordinate when place inside the grid.\n    let cell_x = (point.0 as f64 / self.cell_size).floor();\n    let cell_y = (point.1 as f64 / self.cell_size).floor();\n    // Calculate the index within our flat array and place the point\n    // there.\n    let cell_idx = (cell_y * self.cell_width + cell_x) as usize;\n    self.grid[cell_idx] = Some(point);\n}\nSelecting an initial point\nFor the next step of the algorithm, we need to select an initial sample.\nThis will be randomly chosen uniformly from the domain, inserted into the\ngrid, and used as the initial point on the \"active list\".\nFirst, let’s add the rand crate to our\ndependencies in our Cargo.toml file.\n[dependencies]\nrand = \"0.6.5\"\n\nAfterwards, modify the new function so that we generate a new point after\ninitializing the PoissonDisk struct, adding it to both grid and active\nlist.\nPutting it all together with the example code that we have so far, the\nnew function should look a little something like below.\nuse rand;\n\nstruct PoissonDisk {\n    ...,\n    // \"Active list\" used to keep track of sampled points we are able\n    // to generate new points around.\n    active: Vec&lt;(usize, usize)&gt;\n}\n\nimpl PoissonDisk {\n    pub fn new(w: usize, h: usize, r: usize, k: usize) -&gt; Self {\n        // Instead of immediately returning the newly construct struct\n        // let store it in a variable and generate the initial point.\n        let disk = PoissonDisk {\n            ...,\n            active: Vec::new(),\n        };\n\n        // Here we generate the new point.\n        let rng = rand::thread_rng();\n        let point = (\n            (rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;() * w as f64) as usize,\n            (rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;() * h as f64) as usize\n        );\n\n        // Add point to grid &amp; active list.\n        disk.insert_point(point);\n        disk.active.push(point);\n\n        disk\n    }\n}\nSampling points &amp; point validation\nFinally 🎉! Now that we have the ability to keep track of points, sources\nfor new points, and an initial sample to get started we can start\nimplementing the core of the algorithm (Step 2 in the paper).\nThis step involves a loop where:\n\nWe take a random point from the active list\nSample \\(r\\) points around the active point\nIf none of the points are outside \\(r\\) of nearby points, remove this\npoint from the active list.\nOtherwise, add points to active list and continue.\nRepeat until there are no more points on the active list.\n\nBreaking down the loop step by step, we'll first tackle randomly selecting a point\nfrom the active list. Given an active list of length \\(l\\), we randomly\nchoose an index between \\(0\\) and \\(l - 1\\).\n// Generate a random index in our active list.\nlet idx = rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;() * (self.active.len() - 1) as f64;\nlet source = self.active[idx as usize];\n\nNext, we need to sample \\(k\\) new points around the source point. When\ngenerating a new point, we randomly choose a point that is between \\(r\\)\nand \\(2r\\) of the source point. This will make it so that new points will\nalways be at least \\(r\\) length away from the current point. To visualize\nhow this will look on the grid we've created, here's a visualization of the\ndisk where valid points could possible be generated.\n\nGenerated points will appear in a disk that is \\(r\\) is size around the\nsource point. Notice that it overlaps approximately 2 squares away from the\nsource point. This will be important later on when we validate new points.\nThe trick to sampling a point inside this disk is to use polar\ncoordinates! Polar coordinates are represented by a distance\nand angle from a reference point (see image below for an example). Using\nthe source point as our reference point, we randomly choose an angle and a\nrandom radius that is between \\(r\\) and \\(2r\\) and convert this back into\ncartesian coordinates.\n\nAn example of polar coordinates in action courtesy of Wikipedia\nUsing this knowledge, lets create a new function, generate_around,\nthat will generate new points around the source point:\nfn generate_around(&amp;mut self, pt: (usize, usize)) -&gt; (usize, usize) {\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    // Random angle\n    let angle = 2.0 * PI * rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;();\n    // Random radius between r and 2r\n    let radius = self.min_dist as f64 * (rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;() + 1.0);\n    // Convert polar coordinates to cartesian and viola,\n    // a new point is generated around the source point (x, y)\n    let new_x = pt.0 as f64 + (radius * angle.cos());\n    let new_y = pt.1 as f64 + (radius * angle.sin());\n    // Using min/max, we'll also constrain the new point to be within\n    // the bounds of our grid.\n    (\n        new_x.max(0.0).min(self.width as f64 - 1.0) as usize,\n        new_y.max(0.0).min(self.height as f64 - 1.0) as usize,\n    )\n}\n\nNow that we have a new point, how do make sure it's a \"valid\" point?\nValid new points satisfy two constraints:\n\nThey should not be within \\(r\\) of any existing point.\nThey must exist within the width/height bounds.\n\nNote that in our generate_around function we already ensure that new points\nare within our width/height bounds, so we only need to check if the point\nexists within \\(r\\) of other points.\nThe grid that was shown earlier can be used to quickly search for\nneighboring points. Lets bring back the image we used before to showcase\nthe disk area where sampled points will appear.\n\nAs mentioned before, each grid cell is sized in such a way that there\nshould only exist a single point in each cell. Since each cell is a smaller\nthan the radius (\\(\\frac{r}{\\sqrt{2}}\\)), the neighborhood around the\nsource cell will be at most 2 cells away.\nTo find the start and end coordinates of the neighborhood, we'll determine\nwhere the point exists in the grid and +/- 2 from the coordinates.\n// Scale the source point onto the grid.\nlet xidx = (point.0 as f64 / self.grid_size).floor();\nlet yidx = (point.1 as f64 / self.grid_size).floor();\n// Determine the neighborhood around the source point.\nlet start_x = (xidx - 2.0).max(0.0) as usize;\nlet end_x = (xidx + 2.0).min(self.grid_width - 1.0) as usize;\nlet start_y = (yidx - 2.0).max(0.0) as usize;\nlet end_y = (yidx + 2.0).min(self.grid_height - 1.0) as usize;\n\nUsing the cells in this neighborhood we can loop through the neighbors\nof the source point and make sure our new point is outside the radius of\nany nearby points without having to check all points. If no neighbors are\nfound or if we are outside the radius of each neighbor, this point is\nvalid.\nOur is_valid function should now look like the following:\nfn is_valid(&amp;self, point: (usize, usize)) -&gt; bool {\n    // Scale the source point onto the grid.\n    let xidx = (point.0 as f64 / self.grid_size).floor();\n    let yidx = (point.1 as f64 / self.grid_size).floor();\n    // Determine the neighborhood around the source point.\n    let start_x = (xidx - 2.0).max(0.0) as usize;\n    let end_x = (xidx + 2.0).min(self.grid_width - 1.0) as usize;\n    let start_y = (yidx - 2.0).max(0.0) as usize;\n    let end_y = (yidx + 2.0).min(self.grid_height - 1.0) as usize;\n    // Check all non-empty neighbors cells and make sure the new point\n    // is outside their radius.\n    for y in start_y..end_y {\n        for x in start_x..end_x {\n            let idx = y * self.grid_width as usize + x;\n            if let Some(cell) = self.grid[idx] {\n                // This is the standard distance formula between two points.\n                if distance(cell, point) &lt;= self.min_dist as f64 {\n                    return false;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    true\n}\n\nAll that is left is to make sure any source point that were unable to generate\nvalid sample points is remove from our active list.\nPutting it all together, the example code should now look like the following:\npub fn generate(&amp;mut self) {\n    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();\n    while !self.active.is_empty() {\n        let idx = rng.gen::&lt;f64&gt;() * (self.active.len() - 1) as f64;\n        let source = self.active[idx as usize];\n        // Did we find an valid samples?\n        let mut found = false;\n        for _ in 0..self.num_samples {\n            let new_point = self.generate_around(source);\n            // Add the new point to the grid and active list if\n            // the point is valid.\n            if self.is_valid(new_point) {\n                // Add point to our background grid\n                self.insert_point(new_point);\n                // Add point to our active list\n                self.active.push(new_point);\n                // Add point to our list of sampled points\n                self.samples.push(new_point);\n                found = true;\n            }\n        }\n        // If not valid points are found, remove the source point\n        // from the active list.\n        if !found {\n            self.active.remove(idx);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nAnd there you have it!
