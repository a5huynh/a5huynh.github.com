  <p>Climbers who lead routes often speak of having good &quot;lead head&quot; (lead as in
leader), a mental state that lets you break through plateaus in training or
climb challenging routes without that irrationally rational doubt and
uncertainty plaguing your mind. There are even classes where the very purpose
is to mentally train those who wish to push their limits.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>These classes often follow a straightforward and very rigorous regimen designed to push limits over and over. Here's a dramatized example:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, practice climbing at the cusp of your limits.</li>
<li>Now practice falling. Ideally a little above your comfort zone.</li>
<li>Practice falling from even higher.</li>
<li>Do it again.</li>
<li>And then do it again.</li>
</ol>
<p>The idea is to prime yourself into doing the same difficult movements over and
over until it no longer becomes difficult, both physcally and perhaps more
importantly -- mentally. This becomes significant seeing as how nagging feelings of doubt and uncertainty are perhaps more dangerous than the actual act of climbing itself.</p>
<p>When you are focusing on the distance from the ground or worrying about stray
rocks, you block out the very actions that protect you the most. Remembering to
clip in or check your placement; keeping correct form so that you don't get too
tired; and of course, having that clarity of mind to react in case there
is an emergency.</p>
<h2 id="analysis-paralysis">Analysis Paralysis</h2>
<p>The phenomena of &quot;lead head&quot; is not something that is isolated to climbing.
There are examples throughout life of what is usually dubbed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis">analysis
paralysis</a>, causing even the
best people to stumble in situations they may have done hundreds of times
before.</p>
<p>A fun example I recently discovered is a card game called <a href="http://rejectiontherapy.com/">rejection
therapy</a>. I find it akin to the mental training
regimen for climbers albeit for every-day situations. The game seems designed
specifically to put people through life's awkward situations so they can adapt
to the inevitable rejection and failure while most importantly making light of
those moments. You are not successful if you are not being rejected.</p>
<p>At the very core, analysis paralysis is what happens when you are alone in the
echo chamber of your mind. Ideas as well as uncertainty begins to reverberate
and wave after wave of <code>what if</code> washes over you. More often, it's not even
doubt, but simply the feeling that something is not quite good enough and <code>what if</code> you spend a little more tweaking this and tweaking that. <code>what if</code> you made the wrong choice? <code>what if</code> it was all for naught? <code>what if</code>?</p>
<h2 id="the-art-of-start">The Art of Start</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Organizational design, process design, metrics, hiring and firing were all
relatively straightforward skills to master compared to keeping my mind in
check.</p>
<p>~ Ben Horowitz, The Hard Things About Hard Things</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mind is our greatest asset but it might as well be our greatest enemy. In a
field where acting quickly is the name of the game, analysis paralysis becomes
a detrimental addition to one's day-to-day. Startups are <em>agile</em>, they are
<em>lean</em>, and idyllically are meant to move fast and break things. But they are
also run by people, the same people who have nagging feelings of doubt when it
comes to even simple concerns, much less those that come up when running a
company.</p>
<p>Managing your own thoughts and psychology is by far the most difficult part of
entrepreneurship. There may be tips and there may be tricks, but ultimately it
will always fall back to you.</p>
