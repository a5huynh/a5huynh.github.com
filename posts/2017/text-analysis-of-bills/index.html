  <p>As a fun side project, I've been <a href="https://getversed.io">gathering data</a> on bills that are
going through the U.S Senate. So far, the site itself is a pretty simple
web app to display bill status information in an easier to digest format.
This is the first step of many in my goal for an in-depth analysis of the
different of bills that are going through the Senate (and eventually House
of Representatives). Through integration with other publicly available data
hopefully we can gather some interesting insights that are not normally
readily available to a layperson.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>In a series of blog posts, I'm going to use some basic NLP to analyze the bills
that have gone through the Senate for the past year and show some pretty
charts.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>All code used for this analysis is available here:
<a href="https://github.com/a5huynh/bill-analysis">https://github.com/a5huynh/bill-analysis</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the Data</h2>
<p>Bulk congressional data is publicly available as XML for the 115th, 114th,
and 113th congress via the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/about/data">Congressional Bulk Data site</a>. There are
additionally some <a href="https://github.com/usgpo/bill-status">useful guides</a> and <a href="https://github.com/usgpo/bill-status">schema docs</a>
on Github, made publicly available by the USGPO.</p>
<p>Looking at the bulk data site,  the information we are interested in is
divided into:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>BILLS</code>: Contain the full text of the bill.</li>
<li><code>BILLSTATUS</code>: Contains information about that status of the respective
legislation, who (co)sponsored the legislation, and a history of actions
that have been taken.</li>
<li><code>BILLSUM</code>: Contains a short summary text of the bill in question.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this analysis, I'll be using the data available in the <code>BILLS</code> and
<code>BILLSTATUS</code> buckets. If you have clone/forked my previously mentioned
repository, you can run the following command in the root directory to
download and setup the data folders.</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash "><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">make dl-data
</code></pre>
<h2 id="xml-to-plain-text">XML to Plain text</h2>
<p>First off, we need to convert the XML formatted data into something
suitable for our analysis. Looking at the XML files we've unpacked and
using python's built-in <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html">XML parsing</a> utilities, we can see
that the documents are divided into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>metadata</code></li>
<li><code>form</code></li>
<li><code>legis-body</code>: This doesn't appear in every file, just ones that are new legislation.</li>
<li>Amendments will have the <code>amendment</code> tag in place of <code>legis-body</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We're interested in text in the <code>legis-body</code> section, a snippet of which I
pulled out and show below:</p>
<pre data-lang="html" class="language-html "><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><enum>2.</enum>
<header>
    Special resource study of James K. Polk presidential home
</header>
<subsection id="id7de0f50b003d4fde9ed1f7dc4c7214b2">
    <enum>(a)</enum>
    <header>Definitions</header>
    <text>In this section:</text>20
    <paragraph id="idB162332A1BCB420685364EB582B8E9D6">
        <enum>(1)</enum>
        <header>Secretary</header>
        <text>
            The term <term>Secretary</term> means the
            Secretary of the Interior.
        </text>
    </paragraph>
</code></pre>
<p>In each <code>&lt;legis-body&gt;</code> tag there are sections, sub-sections, unique
identifiers, headers, and enums some of which may or may not be useful. For
simplification, we'll <strong>only</strong> look at text in the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> tags and toss
out everything else, turning the above XML into the text snippet below:</p>
<pre data-lang="text" class="language-text "><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">This Act may be cited as the James K. Polk Presidential Home Study Act.
In this section: The term Secretary means the Secretary of the Interior.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="tokenization-stemming">Tokenization &amp; Stemming</h2>
<p>Now that we have plain text, next up is tokenizing and stemming the plain
text from the previous step.</p>
<p><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/tokenization-1.html">Tokenization</a> chops up the plain text into an array of strings and
throwing away certain characters, such as punctuation/numbers and stop
words. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">Stemming</a> takes this further and allows us to map related
words to a single token across an entire corpus. For example, the words
&quot;stem&quot;, &quot;stemming&quot;, &quot;stemmed&quot; can all be mapped to the token &quot;stem&quot; for the
sake of analysis.</p>
<p>Below, I've pulled out the code snippet used in the repository to extract
and stem the tokens. This is accomplished with a combination of features from
<a href="https://spacy.io">spaCy</a>.</p>
<pre data-lang="python" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">import spacy

NLP = spacy.load('en', disable=['parser', 'ner', 'textcat'])

def txt_to_token(txt : str):
    results = []
    for token in NLP(txt):
        # Ignore numbers, stop words, and punctuation
        if not token.is_alpha or token.is_stop \
           or token.is_punct or token.is_space:
            continue
        results.append(token.lemma_)

    return results
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>As a side note, I just want to note that the <code>spaCy</code> documentation is
well designed and was really a pleasure to read through and use during
this process.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="running-simple-analyses">Running Simple Analyses</h2>
<p>When I started down the path for this blog post I was interested in
uncovering a couple things from the dataset:</p>
<ul>
<li>Topics of interest often discussed in bills.</li>
<li>Interesting trends over the years, perhaps correlated with the political
makeup of the Senate.</li>
<li>Anything else we can scrounge up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets start with topics of interest. With the tokens we've created in our
data preparation step, we can play around with some statistics of the
corpus to find anything interesting.</p>
<p>I'll first start with a basic, word frequency chart just to see if there's
anything unexpected.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2017/12/word-freqs.png" alt="Word Frequencies" />
<em>A visualization of the 50 most frequent tokens. <a href="/img/2017/12/word-freqs.png">Click here</a>
for the full image.</em></p>
<p>The top 50 tokens seem normal based on the corpus of data. There are plenty
of ones we'd expect in legislation and some interesting tokens (e.g.
<code>security</code> and <code>health</code>) that may point to topics that are most discussed
in these bills. However, overall, not immensely useful until we can remove
tokens that are present in all documents.</p>
<p>To ignore tokens that appear throughout the entire corpus and bubble up
words that may be more interesting, lets use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf">TF-IDF</a> with some
constraints on the max document frequency to get a list of important tokens
in the corpus.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is TF-IDF?</strong></p>
<p><code>TF-IDF</code> increases the score of a token proportionally by
how many times it shows up in a document, offset by the number of times the
token shows up in the entire corpus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html">scikit-learn</a>, calculating the tf-idf score for all documents
is super easy. Here's a small snippet that demonstrates the calculation</p>
<pre data-lang="python" class="language-python "><code class="language-python" data-lang="python">from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf = TfidfVectorizer(
    max_df=0.5,
    # Note: Since we've already tokenized the documents in
    # the data preparation step, we'll skip these steps
    # in the TfidfVectorizer.
    preprocessor=lambda x: x,
    tokenizer=lambda x: x
)

# Features contains all the tokens as used by TfidfVectorizer
features = tfidf.get_feature_names()
# Create a matrix where each row represents the tf-idf vector
# for a particular document.
scores = tfidf.fit_transform(token_dict.values())
</code></pre>
<p>With the scores in a matrix, we can easily average the tf-idf scores and
pull the tokens with the top scores to get a general sense of the important
tokens in the entire corpus. Below is a visualization of those scores
which seems to give a better sense of legislative topics, such as
<code>security</code>, <code>health</code>, <code>education</code>, etc.</p>
<p><img src="/img/2017/12/word-tfidf.png" alt="Words by TF-IDF" />
<em>A visualization of the top 50 words by tf-idf. <a href="/img/2017/12/word-tfidf.png">Click here</a>

<h2 id="discussion-next-time">Discussion &amp; Next Time</h2>
<p>That's it for now!</p>
<p>In the next part of this series, I'll dig a little deeper into the content
of the bills and correlate topics with how likely things are to make it all
the way through the Senate. We'll additionally take a look at the
<code>BILLSTATUS</code> dataset and use it conjunction with the <code>BILLS</code> dataset for
more interesting insights.</p>
