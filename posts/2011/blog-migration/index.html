  <p>Recently, it dawned upon me that I haven't sat down and wrote down anything of substance for a while. Oh sure, there's the occasional research paper that I spearhead, but that often feels like work. Additionally, I can't just put it up somewhere for everyone to see while it's under review. And even after review, who wants to read some random research paper anyways?</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>So here's my thing ( which I hope I'll stick with ). I'm going to write. <em>All the time</em>. It could be anything I fancy or can even think about. The point is to develop and hone my technique and so-called &quot;voice&quot; by pure and simple practice. Every week ( let's say weekend-ish ), I'll post something up. It can be something of substance, like an article detailing my latest research or something absolutely trivial ( but somewhat interesting ) like my favorite song of the week.</p>
<h2 id="github-pages">GitHub Pages</h2>
<p>I enjoy writing but it seems to me a lot of my time spent on blogging platforms ( such as Posterous, Blogger, etc. ) happened to reside with <em>formatting</em>. As a self-proclaimed design and typography geek, I could spend hours upon hours tweaking the look and feel of a particular blog post without really adding much content. In the end all I have is a really clean and nice looking sentence or two.</p>
<p>I looked around for ( and even thought of writing my own ) a solution to this fickly problem. While writing I enjoy using <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">Markdown</a> because it allows me to write a well-formatted post in a plain ol' text editor without all that extra cruft that I didn't really need or care about. The difficulty was then putting that onto a site <em>and</em> making it look good in the process.</p>
<p>Then I found a little something called <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>.</p>
<p>If you don't write code for a living or as a hobby then GitHub will probably be unknown or foreign to you. That's ok. The gist of it is that I can type up my posts and articles in the lovely mark-up language Markdown, type a few commands in the terminal, and <strong>pow</strong> it's synced and ( almost ) instantly displayed online.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would have support for handy dandy things like...</p>
<h3 id="latex-support">Latex Support!</h3>
<p>I just start with some dollar signs, some notation, and <strong>boom!</strong> $$r_{s} = \frac{2Gm}{c^2}$$ Schwarzschild radius.</p>
<h3 id="code-w-syntax-highlighting">Code w/ syntax highlighting!</h3>
<pre style="background-color:#272822;">
<code><span style="font-style:italic;color:#f92672;">def </span><span style="color:#a6e22e;">hello</span><span style="color:#f8f8f2;">:
    </span><span style="color:#f92672;">print </span><span style="color:#e6db74;">&#39;Hello!&#39;
</span></code></pre>
<p>Just think of all those fancy posts with code I'll get to write someday. Oooh boy my giblets are tingling already.</p>
