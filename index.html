electronics was to build a small device from the ground up. This would
include sourcing all parts, writing the necessary code, and designing and

      <div class='post-excerpt'><p>Amid the flurry of preparation for a new year, I sat down to reflect upon the
one that has just passed. Every year I enter the next a little more optimistic
and a little more excited. Part of it due to the potential of unknown unknowns
(be it good or bad), and part of it due to thought of spending another year
with those that I truly care about and those that I enjoy being around.</p>

      <div class='post-excerpt'><p>There would be those who see a lot of glamour in start-ups and the whole
concept of entrepreneurship. It is romanticized by the media who broadcasts
million dollar valuations and billion dollar acquisitions. And for many, it is
the ultimate meritocracy, appealing to those whom other cracies never appealed.
The meritocracy was a guarantee that those with the smarts and know-how were
adequately rewarded while those who fell short of godliness, failed. It evened
the playing field for all, so much so that even the most out of place could
still find a place.</p>

Oh sure, there's the occasional research paper that I spearhead, but that often feels like work. Additionally, I can't just put it up somewhere for everyone to see while it's under review.

simply opt for her favorite candies, which are so much her favorite that it
has become almost mandatory with whatever else I intend to get. This candy
has become so prevalent in holidays that I consider it a tax, an 'Andrew'
tax if you will, that I'll be paying for years to come due the hassle of
raising me.</p>

      <div class='post-excerpt'><p>So a little background on my implementation (feel free to skip this)....</p>
<p>In my freshman year at UCSD I was recruited by <a href="http://cses.ucsd.edu">CSES</a>
to work on a small game project. It was supposed to be generic enough so
that the frontend (my game engine) could connect to a back-end that could
be written in any language as long as it conformed to a set of standards we
had. Things like retrieving player position, setting player position,
getting maps, etc. So long story short, I needed a pathfinding algorithm
for the game engine, and my experiment with the A* algorithm began.</p>
